Hello! My name is Jordan Eldredge. I am a programmer and musician living in the San Francisco Bay Area with my wife [Chelsea Hollow](http://chelseahollow.com) and awesome daughter.

## Programming

I've been writing software as a hobby since I was in High School. After college, it evolved naturally into a career. Since about 2009 I have been a full-time engineer. I currently work at Meta on the [Relay](https://relay.dev/) team.  Check out my [projects](/projects) page or [GitHub profile](https://github.com/captbaritone).

## Singing

I graduated from San Francisco State University with a Bachelors in Music and enjoyed a busy semi-professional singing schedule for many years. I've since chosen to focus more on software, but information about my singing, including photos and past performances, can still be found at my [singer website](/singer).
