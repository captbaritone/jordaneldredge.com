The fellas from the [Cracking the Cryptic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAyZ9K2EBF0) Youtube channel have released an iOS app containing tons of brilliant hand-crafted puzzles. There are several included for free and each one is a treat. If you’re interested in variant sudoku, or think you might be, I’d highly recommend it!
