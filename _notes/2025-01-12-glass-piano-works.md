In my Spotify Wrapped this year I was reminded that I’ve been obsessively listening to this album of Philip Glass piano works performed by the Icelandic pianist [Víkingur Ólafsson](https://www.vikingurolafsson.com/).

This year Ólafsson was touring the world playing one of my very favorite pieces of music, the Bach Goldberg Variations, which I first fell in love with as part of the [Open Goldberg Variations](https://jordaneldredge.com/notes/open-goldberg/) project. I was able to catch one of his performances in Berkeley in May, and it was incredible.

In the summer, when planning a flight abroad for work, I was searching Spotify for albums to download and listen to on the flight. I came across this album of Glass’ piano works and downloaded it.

I’d recommend the exhilarating Etude 6 as a good starting point if you want to have a listen. The combination of blistering tempo and textual clarity must be heard to be believed.
