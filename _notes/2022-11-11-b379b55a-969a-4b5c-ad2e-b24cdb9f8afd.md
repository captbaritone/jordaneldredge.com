This incredible long-read by Neil Stephenson published in Wired about the historical progression of long distance communication technology, interwoven with the modern day geo-political and technical implications of undersea fiberoptic cables is a fascinating read. Stephenson’s writing style is as captivating as the information he shares.


Despite its length, I’ve reread this essay about three times.
