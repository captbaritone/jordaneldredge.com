Back in 2018 I did [an interview](https://jordaneldredge.com/blog/) with Changelog podcast about Webamp. I recently caught to catch up with Jerod and Adam again! This episode was in their talk show format so it was just a casual conversation about nostalgia, Winamp, the Winamp Skin Museum, Napster, file sharing, music and more. We also spent some time talking about [The bizarre secrets I found investigating corrupt Winamp skins](https://jordaneldredge.com/notes/corrupted-skins/).
