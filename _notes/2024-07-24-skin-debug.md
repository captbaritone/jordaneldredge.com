Shhhh. Don't tell anyone, but the [Winamp Skin Museum](https://skins.webamp.org/) has a secret debug mode.

Press "d" when viewing a skin to inspect its sprite sheets, cursors, configuration files and more. This was super easy to build based on the [Winamp Skin Museumâ€™s GraphQL endpoint](https://jordaneldredge.com/notes/winamp-sqlite/).
