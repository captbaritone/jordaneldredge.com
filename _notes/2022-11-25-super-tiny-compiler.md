As someone who never got a computer science degree, compilers seemed like something that would somehow be too complicated for me to understand. The Super Tiny Compiler by Jamie Kyle played a large part in breaking down that assumption and helping me see that compilers are just programs like anything else.

The Super Tiny Compiler is a simple — but complete — end-to-end compiler in a single ~1,000 line, JavaScript file. It’s heavily annotated with comments which teach the concepts behind compilers as you read through the code from top to bottom.
