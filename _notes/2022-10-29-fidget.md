My daughter and I built this little fidget toy out of LEGO, and it’s hypnotizing to play with. I’ve been keeping it at my desk and even months later it’s still as captivating as the day we built it. Perfect for fiddling with during video meetings.

If you don’t have the pieces needed, you can find pre-built ones on ebay.

I’ve also seen another infinity cube fidget toy built from LEGO Technic ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbPBwtX-BaE)). I didn’t have the pieces to build it myself, so I ordered one from ebay. I found it disappointing. It’s very floppy and prone to getting stuck in a bad state.
