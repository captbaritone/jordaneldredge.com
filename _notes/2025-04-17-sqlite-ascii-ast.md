Watching [this 2015 talk from Richard Hipp](https://youtube.com/watch?v=gpxnbly9bz4) about SQLite and learned that you can configure SQLite (at build time) to emit cool ascii art of its parse AST as well as IR at various points during compilation/optimization. Presumably this mode is used by SQLIte’s own developers for debugging parsing and IR transformation issues.

I had to pass `--enable-debug` when running `configure` before running make. Then ran the following pragmas before issuing my query:

```text
.selecttrace 0xfff
.wheretrace 0xfff
```

## Explain

Another cool debug feature is SQLite’s `EXPLAIN` which prints the [bytecode](https://sqlite.org/whybytecode.html) for a given query in a cute table format (what else would you expect!). For example:

```text
sqlite> EXPLAIN SELECT `title` from `content` WHERE `tags` LIKE "%sqlite%";
addr  opcode         p1    p2    p3    p4             p5  comment

12    Goto           0     1     0                    0
```

I particularly like that the `comment` column contains a little translation of what the instruction will do.
