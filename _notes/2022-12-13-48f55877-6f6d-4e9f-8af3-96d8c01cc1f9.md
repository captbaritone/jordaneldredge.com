So many games rely on a model where you have some score, and as you progress through the game not only does your score increase, but the _rate_ of increases increases. This creates a great incentive to continue progressing in the game. “If I can just get that next item, I’ll be getting _double_ points!”. In fact, this model is so compelling to the human mind, that the actual gameplay is pretty much unimportant. This gets exploited so much that there’s a whole genre of games built around it called “[increment games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game)” or “clicker games”.

Universal Paperclips is a game in this genera that also seems to be commentary of the genera itself. What’s more, it leverages the mechanic of exponentially increasing scores to tell a compelling story of exponentially increasing computing power and the artificial intelligence singularity.
