Sometimes setting the expectation that you are the local <technology> expert can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

People from across the company/team come to you with questions. You don’t know the answers, but “you’re the expert“, so it’s your job to go find out. Repeat.

Before long, you start to know the answers, and you have broad context of what’s going on across the company/team. Prophecy fulfilled!
