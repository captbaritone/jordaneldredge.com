For a while before the Covid 19 pandemic, I sang with a San Francisco based mens chorus called [Fog City Singers](https://www.fogcitysingers.com/). They were a new-ish choral group that grew out of the barbershop tradition. Here are some videos that the group made during the period I was singing with them:
