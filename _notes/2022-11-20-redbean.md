Redbean is just the craziest project. Justine Tunney discovered a way to construct a binary that is a functioning excitable on six operating systems while also being a valid zip archive.

When executed the executable/zip starts up a web server which serves up its zip contents, including a built in Lua interpreter and SQLite database which allows you to build dynamic web apps into your single portable binary. Even better, due to its obsession over tiny size, the performance of the server is insane: “1.1 million qps on a personal computer”.

This is project is pure nerd worship. What Justine has done here — and elsewhere, you should read all about her other projects — is super-human in terms of hacker credibility.
