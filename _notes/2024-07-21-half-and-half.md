The funniest Alexa interaction I’ve had.

One of our family’s most common uses for our Alexa is main a shopping list. It works really well! Just say “Alexa, add <item name>” from anywhere in the kitchen and it’s on the list.

One day I was using up the last of the half & half so I said “Alexa, add half & half”, like I’d done dozens of times before. But for some reason this time it replied:

“One half plus one half equals one”

I mean, it’s not wrong!
