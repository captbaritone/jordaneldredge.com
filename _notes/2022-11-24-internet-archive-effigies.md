Did you know that the [Internet archive](https://archive.org/) has a physical location? And that that physical location is an old church with active servers spinning in the sanctuary?

Did you further know that the sanctuary is populated with literally hundreds of sculptures representing people who have worked for the archive?

Now you do. As I understand it, if you work for the Archive for a certain period of time, Brewster, the creator of the Archive will honor you by commissioning one of these small sculpture to be made in your image.
