Ever since hearing [Glen Gould’s electrifying recording of the Bach’s Goldberg Variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bach:_The_Goldberg_Variations_\(Glenn_Gould_album\)), his debut album recorded in 1956 when was just 24, I’ve been obsessed with this piece. In that recording Gould opened my ears to what Bach _could_ be. His playing, which seemed more interested in sharing the melodic and contrapuntal _ideas_ in Bach’s music than producing something that was sonorously “beautiful”, allowed Bach to finally click for me.

This has lead to a life-long love of the Goldberg Variations both as a listener and as a (very amateur) player. There are only a few variations I can make it through at anything approaching the correct tempo, but I enjoy playing them none the less.

Here I am making my way through the first (and last) movement: “Aria”
