Neil Cicierega’s album Mouth Dreams is his most recent installment in his series of mashup albums. As a musician, I can attest that they are as virtuosic in their execution as they are witty and hilarious in their musical commentary and construction.

My understanding is that the origin of this project was someone realizing that one could unpack the Guitar Hero games to extract the isolated instrument/vocal tracks from many popular songs.

I keep returning to this album and forcing it upon my musical friends. Every track has dozens of “shh, listen to this part!” moments, but track seven is a musically perfect mashup which somehow manages to seamlessly combine:

- [The Partridge Family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Partridge_Family)'s "C'mon, Get Happy"
- [Chili's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili%27s) ["Baby Back Ribs" jingle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili%27s#Advertising)
- [Tears for Fears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears_for_Fears)' "[Everybody Wants to Rule the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everybody_Wants_to_Rule_the_World)"
- [Marilyn Manson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Manson)'s "[The Beautiful People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beautiful_People_\(song\))"
- [The Tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tokens)' "[The Lion Sleeps Tonight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_Sleeps_Tonight)"
- [Aerosmith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosmith)'s "Dream On" (lead-in to next track)

_Update June 24, 2025: it was only several years after I fell in love with his Mouth Sounds mashups that I connected the dots and learned that Neil is also the person behind that early YouTube meme the Harry Potter pals._
