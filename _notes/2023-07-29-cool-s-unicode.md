TIL there was a (joke) [proposal](https://github.com/Crissov/unicode-proposals/issues/408) to add the “cool s” to the Unicode standard.

Someone counter proposed that rather than adding a special symbol 🆒 could become a modifier symbol.

I love the idea!

🙂+🆒=😎
X+🆒= 𝕏

The possibilities are endless!
