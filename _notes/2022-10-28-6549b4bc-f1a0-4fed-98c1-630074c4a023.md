  Can’t use Shiki (and likely other Wasm-based tools) in Next 13 server

It seems Next 13 bundles server code using Webpack. This does not play well with [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) which uses `require.resolve` to [locate a Wasm file in a sibling package](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/blob/1ad7634f729f48d55838be9b3e08134e390d7f33/packages/shiki/src/loader.ts#L58-L61) and pull it in via `fs.readFileSync`. I suspect many Wasm based packages end up needing to do something like this, since Node does not offer a first-class way to require binary Wasm code.


The error it throws is:


```text
error - unhandledRejection: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open
'(sc_server)/node_modules/vscode-oniguruma/release/onig.wasm
```
