If you are interested in how computer languages work, or how they are implemented I can’t think of a better book than Bob Nystrom’s [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

He sets out to dispel the notion that compilers and interpreters are some advanced type of programming that can only be understood by an upper echelon of computer wizard and succeeds roundly in that goal.

The book is incredibly approachable and written in a practical, plain-spoken, engaging and often subtlety humorous style. You are left with a practical understanding that compilers are just a collection of loops and if statements like any other program, and — if you decide to follow along — your very own interpreter and compiler.

Even better, the entire beautifully typeset book is available online for free!

This book helped me teach myself to [build my own compiler](https://jordaneldredge.com/blog/speeding-up-winamps-music-visualizer-with-webassembly/) which eventually lead to me getting hired on a [team](https://relay.dev/) where I am able to work on a compiler full time!
