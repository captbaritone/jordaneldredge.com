summary: A humorous quip by my high school sociology teacher

I still remember this quip by my high school sociology teacher, the booming, and much beloved, Mr. Steadman at Petaluma High:

> Life! The only sexually transmitted diseases thatâ€™s always fatal.

Of course the quote is not his own, but the true origin seems [unclear](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/01/29/life/?amp=1).
