  Despite spending a fair portion of my adult life thinking about keeping Winamp
  skins accessible and preserved. But I was never a real skin creator myself.

Between [Webamp](https://webamp.org/), archiving [Winamp Skins a the Internet Archive](https://jordaneldredge.com/notes/ia-skins/) and the [Winamp Skin Museum](https://jordaneldredge.com/blog/winamp-skin-musuem/), I’ve spent a fair bit of time thinking about Winamp and Winamp Skins as an adult. This is partially inspired by the [impact](https://jordaneldredge.com/blog/this-software-is-punk-rock/) Winamp skins had on me as a teen.

I was quite fascinated with Winamp skins as a teen. I was in awe of the artists who created them, and spent a good deal of time learning how they were made. However I never had much of an aptitude for design. So, I only ever made one skin. In retrospect I think I was mostly interested in _how_ to make them. That said, I do remember having a visceral sense of exhilaration that lasted several day the first moment my skin loaded I was able to interaction with an application that I had, in a very minor way, created.

So, the skin I made is mostly just a demonstration. I was trying to drill down into all the details of what each pixel _did_ more than having any real design goal. For your ~~schadenfreude~~ enjoyment, I present TealAmp:

Poking into the skin I found the readme file which is a pretty funny read all these years later:

-------
- This skin does NOT include a mini browser 
because I despise the idea that a music program
should have a browser when we all already have
one. 

INSTALATION
-----------
1. Place this zip file in the Winamp skin file 
(Usually 'C:\program files\winamp\skins\) 

2. Open Winamp and press Alt-S this should open 
a box with a number of skins listed in it. Click
on 'TEALamp*'.

3. Close the box.

made using Paint Shop Pro 5.5 and a slow imagination.

NOTES TO SKIN AUTHORS
---------------------
Though I am just a novice but I have noticed things in winamp 
that even some of the best skin makers did not take into acount.

-The last two title bars in Titlebar.bmp are the title bars
(selected and unselected) that are used when the easter egg is 
activated. (Type the word 'nullsoft' slowly typing esc after 
each 'l' brings up the OPEN menue.)

-The three numbers in the EQ (+120db, +0db, -120db) are buttons
that put all the bars at the top, middle, and bottom, 
(respectivly)

I also recall that my favorite Winamp skin was [TopazAmp](https://skins.webamp.org/skin/5349df7abe874422611dfe1fee5062fb/TopazAmp_v5.wsz/).
