summary: An observation that Vim mode is a type of API

I recently saw a [Tweet](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1644461104121237505?s=46&t=tPD-R2GpPiURrdcPkIQrww) asking “what’s your favorite piece of API design?”. After contemplating it a bit, I realized it’s probably Vim Mode.


Vim Mode is a terse, memorable, declarative, composable language for describing my code editing intent


I interact with this api hundreds of times a minute while coding, and do so below the level of conscious thought.
