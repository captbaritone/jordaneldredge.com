For the last year or more I’ve been addicted to watching these two middle-aged English men solve variant sudoku. They post two videos a day (one each), often up to an hour in length. The videos showcase brilliant hand-constructed variant sudoku puzzles (sudoku with additional rules and tricks). The puzzles contain incredible emergent logic varying from coloring problems to surprising applications of set theory. The only thing more captivating than the fascinating puzzles is the combination of genuine enthusiasm, and brilliant puzzle logic of Simon and Mark, the hosts of the channel.

This channel has become my go-to entertainment while watching dishes, or when I’m feeling stressed or overwhelmed. Puzzles give me a sense of a world in order, where all problems have logical solutions, and finding that solution is inevitable.
