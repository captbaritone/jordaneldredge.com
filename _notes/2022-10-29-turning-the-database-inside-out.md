This blog post (expand from a talk) is one of the technical pieces of writing I’ve found myself rereading over and over. While it’s technically about distributed databases, I came to while learning about Redux, and I must say, if you are interested in how state is modeled in computer systems, I can think of few pieces of writing which will help more in establishing a great mental model.
