summary: Reflecting on parallels between chord notation and software language design

In computer programming, a [domain-specific language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) (DSL) is a tiny programming language or notation system which is purpose-built for a niche use case. These are generally far less capable than a so-called “general purpose” programming language, but trade that capability for being able to express intent at a higher level of abstraction within its domain. They tend to be “declarative”, meaning they describe _what_ to do, rather than _how_ to do it. Finally, they are often embedded within programs written in a more powerful general-purpose language.


Examples include, languages for expressing patterns of text (Regular Expressions), or languages for expressing data to be read from or written to a database (SQL).


It occurred to me that DSLs may exist outside of computer programming and so I looked to the other field where I have the most experience, music. Surprisingly there are a number of examples that likely qualify, but there is one example that clearly checks all the boxes: chord notation.


For example: `C#m7b9`


Chord notation has its own tiny grammar, is declarative and is generally embedded within a more general purpose language (notation system).


This makes me wonder which other disciplines have evolved DSLs, and what could we learn by looking at them as a multidisciplinary concept? Are there certain conditions which generally tend to lead to the development of a DSL? Are there properties that successful examples have in common?
