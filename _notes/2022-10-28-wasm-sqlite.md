This sounds super exciting for local first heavy web apps, and PWAs. This seems like a great alternative to [Web SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_SQL_Database) which, as I understand it, was never able to get standardized because it would have required specifying SQLite. What people really want isâ€¦ just SQLite. This lets us have that, and leaves open the door to future iteration that is at a faster pace than standards bodies move.

Of particular interest are the [persistent storage options](https://sqlite.org/wasm/doc/trunk/persistence.md) being explored.
