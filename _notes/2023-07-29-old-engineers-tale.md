summary: My dad‘s reframing of a sexist idiom

Growing up, my dad, an electrical engineer, would always say “an old engineer’s tale” instead of “an old wives tale”.

I love how this simultaneously undercut a sexist idiom, and highlighted how susceptible “technical” people can be to cargo culting and blind parroting of “facts” that they have not actually verified.
