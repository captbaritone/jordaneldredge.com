Jones Forth is an implementation of the elegant and fascinating Forth programming language in x86 assembly. Now, before you go running, it’s written as an in depth introduction to Forth and does not require in-depth understanding of assembly to appreciate and enjoy.

The source code is mostly comments and reads more like a blog post with inline code examples than source code. The text is friendly and inviting and feature many ascii art diagrams.

As someone who never really “got” what made Forth so special, this implementation really helped it click for me.
