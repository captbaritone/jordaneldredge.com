I‚Äôve found that I keep coming back to the ideas [Kent Beck](/146376e237518029b2cdf543e1ae7dc4) shared in this article. He describes how some engineers have brains built for holding lots of complexity and can thrive in highly complex code bases and system. But others (üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) cannot. For us, the challenge becomes finding modes of working which systematically tame that complexity.

Like finding a sub-linear algorithm, mastering this meta skill can let us feeble-brained engineers keep pace, or even outpace our big-brained peers.
