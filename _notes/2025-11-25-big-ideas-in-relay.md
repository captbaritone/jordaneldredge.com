I gave [three talks](https://graphql.org/conf/2025/speakers/jordaneldredge1/) at GraphQL Conf. in Amsterdam this year (2025). They are starting to be published on the GraphQL Foundation’s Youtube channel and the first one is “The Big Ideas in Relay”.

From my description of the talk:

> Relay, Meta’s advanced GraphQL client for React, has many innovative capabilities not available in other clients. We will explore these capabilities, what they are, how they work, and the fundamental problems they solve.
>
> - Ensure data consistency with a normalized cache
> - Bound memory usage with user-land garbage collection
> - Avoid append-only queries by statically detecting unused fields
> - Bound JavaScript bundle size with Data Driven Dependencies
> - Build snappy, robust, mutations with rebasing optimistic updates
> - Preload code and data for any surface in just one network roundtrip with Entrypoints
> - Enable optimal data fetching without sacrificing local reasoning with Relay’s compiler
>
> And more!
