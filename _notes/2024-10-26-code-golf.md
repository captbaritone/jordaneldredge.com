Several years ago (a decade?) I was chatting with a work colleague about [code golfing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf) and we had the idea to try to golf some of the interview questions we used at work. One of the questions was to flatten a deeply nested list. I came up with this very funny JavaScript answer, of which I am still proud:

```javascript
var flatten=l=>eval(`[${l}]`)
```

This “works” because JavaScript will implicitly cast the array to a string, and JavaScript’s way of serializing an array is to make it a comma separated list without any brackets. Thus, nested lists just become a flat list:

```javascript
String([10, [20, 30, [40]]])
// => '10,20,30,40'
```

And `eval` then rehydrates the string back into a real Array of values.
