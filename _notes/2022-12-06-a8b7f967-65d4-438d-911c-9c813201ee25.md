Jamie Kyle, author of [Super Tiny Compiler](https://jordaneldredge.com/notes/9f2687e9-f871-4da3-b251-48b04b5f2be7/), also wrote an educational implementation of a type checker in the same vein. This one he never got around to publishing publicly on GitHub, but he did share it as a thread on Twitter.

It’s a super minimal implementation of a type checker which provides a great way for someone new to the concept — like myself — to start to understand the ideas in a concrete way.
