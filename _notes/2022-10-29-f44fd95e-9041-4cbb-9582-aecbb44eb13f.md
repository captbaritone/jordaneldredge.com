Neil Cicierega’s album Mouth Dreams is his most recent installment in his series of mashup albums. As a musician, I can attest that they are as virtuosic in their execution as they are witty and hilarious in their musical commentary and construction.

I keep returning to this album and forcing it upon my musical friends. Every track has dozens of “shh, listen to this part!” moments, but track seven is a musically perfect mashup which somehow manages to seamlessly combine:

- [The Partridge Family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Partridge_Family)'s "C'mon, Get Happy"
- [Chili's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili%27s) ["Baby Back Ribs" jingle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili%27s#Advertising)
- [Tears for Fears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears_for_Fears)' "[Everybody Wants to Rule the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everybody_Wants_to_Rule_the_World)"
- [Marilyn Manson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Manson)'s "[The Beautiful People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beautiful_People_\(song\))"
- [The Tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tokens)' "[The Lion Sleeps Tonight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_Sleeps_Tonight)"
- [Aerosmith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosmith)'s "Dream On" (lead-in to next track)
