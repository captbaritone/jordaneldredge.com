Brilliant mashup musician [Neil Cicierega](http://www.neilcic.com/) overlayed Disturbed's "Down with the Sickness" over the iconic “clap clap clap clap clap” moment in the theme song “I’ll be there for you” by the Rembrandts from the TV show Friends.

I learned about this years ago, and probably think about it once a week. It’s poisoned my brain. The contrast is 👨‍🍳👌.

This excerpt is from a song on his [Mouth Silence](http://www.neilcic.com/mouthsilence/) mashup album.
