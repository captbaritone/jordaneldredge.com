This talk by [Gary Bernhardt](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/) from PyCon 2014 is the [_Idiocracy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy) of tech talks, in that itâ€™s a piece of humerus fiction that is slowly becoming a documentary over time.

Given from the fictional year 2035, it includes amazing (for 2014) demos of various pieces of software being transpield to JavaScript and running in the browser. However, it then goes on to explain how JavaScript ate the world, and replaced the kernel.

As JavaScript continues its march from the browser to the server to the desktop to the edge, and [asm.js](http://asmjs.org/) evolves into Wasm, this talk really drives home just how powerful it is to have a language which is cross platform and sandboxed.
