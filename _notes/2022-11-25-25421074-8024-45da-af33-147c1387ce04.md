The The International Obfuscated C Code Contest is (was?) and amazing annual contest to see who could come up with the most interesting obfuscated use the the C programming language.


My all time favorite is this entry from 2001:

It’s a program that takes in a depth map and generates an ascii [Magic Eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Eye) (remember those books of seemingly random patters that when you squinted at them correctly revealed a 3D image?). What’s more impressive though, is that the code _itself_ is a Magic Eye! If you squint at the image correctly you should see the characters “IO CCC” in two centered lines of text.
