summary: Probably the funniest vandalism I’ve ever seen

As a kid I remember driving past a self storage place where some prankster had removed the initial letter from their huge “Self Storage” sign. So, there was a giant sign reading “ELF STORAGE” above rows and rows of enclosed boxes.


I think about that sign every month or so, and it’s still funny.
