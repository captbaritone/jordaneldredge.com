I got my very own deck of these gorgeous cards by well known shader guru [Patricio Gonzalez Vivo](http://patriciogonzalezvivo.com/). Each card features a stunning shape as well as the terse [GLSL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/3D_on_the_web/GLSL_Shaders) shader code which generates the shape shown. Iâ€™m not sure which is more stunning, the beautifully produced cards, or the elegance of the mathematical descriptions of the shapes.

Great for anyone deep into shader code, or those curious to learn more (like me!).
