This last weekend it was raining and had some rare time off. This put me in a nostalgic mood and my mind locked on playing [Mario 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_64) as the perfect way to jump back in time to those long lazy afternoons staying in and playing video games.

I ended up heading to Best Buy where I found a wireless [Xbox controller](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/xbox-wireless-controller/8xn59crbsqgz). It turns out these days wireless controller “just work” on Mac via Bluetooth. So it was a simple process to hook up the controller, download OpenEmu.

OpenEmu is an emulator framework that comes with emulators for many old systems and a beautiful UI for managing your emulators, games, and controllers.

Putting these all together, my wife and I were able to spend a lazy evening reliving the past trading off lives/stars as we played trough Mario 64 again.
