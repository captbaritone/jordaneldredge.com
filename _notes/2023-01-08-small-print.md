summary: A great Tom Waits quip on the nature of “small print”
---
[Tom Waits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Waits) is eminently quotable, but  my favorites comes from the song [Step Right Up](http://www.tomwaits.com/songs/song/322/Step_Right_Up/).


> The large print giveth and the small print taketh away


I think it perfectly encapsulates the skepticism one should have when reading marketing copy.
