[Tom Lehrer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Lehrer), the musical satirist and professor of mathematics, is a personal hero of mine. Recently [my brother](https://thatsmathematics.com/blog/) showed me this obscure song of his in which he parodies the song “[M-O-T-H-E-R: a word that means the world to me](https://dmr.bsu.edu/digital/collection/ShtMus/id/720)” from the 1910s.
