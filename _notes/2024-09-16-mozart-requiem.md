Back in May I had the privilege of singing the bass solo in the Mozart Requiem with The San Francisco City Chorus alongside my wife [Chelsea Hollow](https://www.chelseahollow.com/). I just discovered that a video of that performance is now on YouTube. You can find it here:

My entrance comes at around 9:40.
