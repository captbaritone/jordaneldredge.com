I just got an email informing me that as part of [Hack Club's](https://hackclub.com/) _You Ship We Ship_ program (where Hack Clubbers write code and get prizes) they’ve launched [SkinAmp](https://sidequests.hackclub.com/skinamp) where, for the next 8 days teens can make their own Winamps skins and upload them to the [Winamp Skin Museum](https://jordaneldredge.com/blog/winamp-skin-musuem/) to win a prize!

The site that they’ve designed for the challenge clearly indicates that they “get it”!

In [This Software is Punk Rock](https://jordaneldredge.com/blog/this-software-is-punk-rock/) I wrote about how Winamp, and Winamp skins in particular, resonated with my generation in _our_ teenage years, and painted an empowering vision of the internet. For this reason seeing this project, and knowing I played a small role in inspiring/enabling it, makes me very pleased indeed. I can’t wait to see what these kids build!
