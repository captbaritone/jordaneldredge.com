For anyone interested in learning about shaders, how they work, and a practical introduction to how to write them, The Book of Shaders by [Patricio Gonzalez Vivo](http://patriciogonzalezvivo.com/) and [Jen Lowe](http://jenlowe.net/) is absolutely the place to start. The book is free online, beautifully put together, charming, and very approachable. What a great gift the authors have given to the internet.
