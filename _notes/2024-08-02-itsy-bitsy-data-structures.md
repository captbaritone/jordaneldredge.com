I love this repository by [Jamie Kyle](https://jamie.build/) called [Itsy Bitsy Data Structures](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/itsy-bitsy-data-structures?tab=readme-ov-file). It includes charmingly commented and approachable implementations of well known data structures in JavaScript. This repository is especially well suited for folks who are used to JavaScript or other interpreted languages and fear that “data structures” are something complicated and “computer science-y”. This repository is inviting, fun and full of useful concepts for those who are curious to learn more about data structures.
