I’m very pleased with the testing strategy I’ve arrived at for [Grats](https://jordaneldredge.com/blog/grats/), a library I maintain for building GraphQL schemas with TypeScript. The strategy has enabled me to edit the code boldly while ensuring the implementation, runtime implications, documentation, and example projects all remain up to date.

In case others would find the approaches useful I’ve documented the strategy, and its four parts, in the Grats docs: <https://grats.capt.dev/docs/faq/testing-strategy>
