The text editor [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is famous for its terse editing keyboard commands. It also features a “macro” mode where you can record these commands and reply them. Whats more, you can actually copy text from your editor and ask Vim to interpret the characters as a macro.

[Linus Åkesson](http://www.linusakesson.net/index.php) (who also created [The Commodordion](https://jordaneldredge.com/notes/deec59a9-cbc0-4eb5-b534-0d32a7a2b482/)) took this to the extreme and created a text file that one can open in Vim, type the commands to copy and execute as a macro: `GY@"`, and it will begin to edit itself into and ascii representation of the [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) fractal!

From [his page](http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/vim/index.php):

> Note: If you have configured vim to use alternate keyboard mappings, these programs won't work. If this is the case, start vim with the standard mapping, i.e. "vim -u NONE mandelbrot".

Update Aug. 18th, 2023: Only recently have I learned that this is the same guy who made the [Commodordian](https://jordaneldredge.com/notes/deec59a9-cbc0-4eb5-b534-0d32a7a2b482/).
