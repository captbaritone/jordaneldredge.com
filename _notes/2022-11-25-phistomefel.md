During the pandemic I became a fan of [Cracking the Cryptic](https://www.youtube.com/c/CrackingTheCryptic), a Youtube Channel in which two English guys solve — often very challenging — variant sudoku puzzles. It turns out these puzzles often have fascinating and clever emergent logic puzzles embedded within them.


One great example, is the Phistomafel Ring, which is a surprising property that _all sudoku puzzles have_!


It states that:


> The 2x2 corner blocks of any Regular 9x9 Sudoku Grid contain exactly the same digits as the cells that border the edge of box 5 (including the corners).


It turns out one can relatively easily deduce this using set equivalence theory, and there have been a number of Sudoku puzzles which set you up to discover this property and then require you to use it to solve the puzzle!


For a detailed and illustrated explanation, see: [https://crackingthecryptic.fandom.com/wiki/Phistomefel_Ring](https://crackingthecryptic.fandom.com/wiki/Phistomefel_Ring)


A nicely illustrated example can be found in this video from the Youtube channel Numberphile where guest Simon Anthony of Cracking the Cryptic walks us through an approachable description:
