The Birth and Death of JavaScript is perhaps one of my favorite talks. It is equal parts hilarious and (increasingly) prophetic. In my mind it’s the tech talk equivalent of the 2006 film _Idiocracy_ in that it’s a comedy that, overtime, is slowly becoming a documentary.

From Gary’s own description:

> This science fiction / comedy / completely serious talk traces the history of JavaScript, and programming in general, from 1995 until 2035. It's not pro- or anti-JavaScript; the language's flaws are discussed frankly, but its ultimate impact on the industry is tremendously positive.

You may recognize Gary Bernhardt from his famous, and even more hilarious talk [Wat](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat). On a more technical note, I’d also highly recommend his talk [Boundaries](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries).
