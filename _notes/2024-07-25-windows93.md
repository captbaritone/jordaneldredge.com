[Windows93.net](http://windows93.net/) is one of the most amazing pieces of digital art I’ve ever seen. Its an in-browser implementation of a topsy-turvy imagining of a fictional Windows 93. Every element on the screen is its own seemingly endless rabbit hole of trolling, glitch astatic, nostalgia and bizarre humor.
