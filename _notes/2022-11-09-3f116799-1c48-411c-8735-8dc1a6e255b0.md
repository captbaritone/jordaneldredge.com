title: 'Mermaid: A little embeddable language for charts and diagrams'

Recently I’ve been loving [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/), it lest you describe charts like graphs (nodes connected with edges) pie charts, gantt charts, state diagrams and more using a cute little domain specific language. What’s better, there’s builtin support for Mermaid within both GitHub and Notion, so you can add charts to your [`readme.md`](http://readme.md/) or the design doc you’re working on in notion.
