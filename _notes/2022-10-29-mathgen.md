Several years ago my brother [put together](https://github.com/neldredge/mathgen) a program forked from [SCIgen](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/archive/scigen/) which uses a context free grammars to be able to generate shockingly convincing looking, while utterly nonsense, math papers. It really highlights how formulaic (heh) the language of academic math papers is, as well as how the elegant formatting of [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) can make even gibberish look convincing.

He also expanded the program to generate entire mathematics book, and then self published them with proceeds going to the American Mathematical Society. They make great gifts or nerd bait to leave on your desk: <https://thatsmathematics.com/blog/mathgen-books/>
