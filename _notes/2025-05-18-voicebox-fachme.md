Back in June 2012 the local Bay Area public radio program VoiceBox had an episode discussing the “fach” system for categorizing operatic voices and roles. As part of that discussion, it turns out they discussed my side project [fachme.com](http://fachme.com/) which attempts to algorithmically determine similar operatic roles. Guests on the show were: [Sheri Greenawald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheri_Greenawald), [Nicola Luisotti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Luisotti), and [Nathan Gunn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Gunn).

My project is discussed Mentioned at 20 minutes 20 seconds.

I first learned about the episode when my neighbor, a retired nurse stopped me in the hall of our apartment building and told me she had heard my name on the radio!
