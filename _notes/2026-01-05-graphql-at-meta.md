I gave [three talks](https://graphql.org/conf/2025/speakers/jordaneldredge1/) at GraphQL Conf. in Amsterdam this year (2025). They are starting to be published on the GraphQL Foundation’s Youtube channel. This second one was a keynote I gave outlining how GraphQL is used at Meta in 2025 and how our use of GraphQL has lead to its continued success inside Meta.

From my description of the talk:

> A peek behind the curtain revealing how GraphQL is used at Meta. We will explore how everything from culture, development process, client and server implementations, schema patterns and conventions, advanced tooling and more work together to allow GraphQL to enable great user and developer experiences at Meta.
