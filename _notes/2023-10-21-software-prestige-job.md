When I was growing up, software was the domain of nerds and social outcasts. The people pursuing it were generally self-motivated individuals who found it intrinsically interesting.

Today, software is a prestige job similar to doctor or lawyer, and the types of young people pursuing it now include (and may even be dominated by) type A go-getters who are driven by a vision of "success" rather than intrinsic interest or curiosity.

Nothing wrong with that, but it's a really different dynamic.
