... in binary.

I couldn't seep last night, so I decided to count sheep. Counting reminded me of the time my brother mentioned that one could count in binary on ones fingers. That sounded pleasantly meditative, so I set my brain to work on figuring out how one might do that. Before long I had counted quite high, and was fascinated by the way the system worked. Naturally my brain wandered to: "how might a computer do this simple task?" By now I had completely lost interest in sleep, so I sneaked out of bed, turned on the laptop and cranked out a little application to count in binary for me. I was then a free to go back to sleep, having automated the tedious task of counting sheep.
