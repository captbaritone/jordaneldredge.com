The server that hosts this blog (as well as all my other projects) has had
a severe problem ever since I upgraded to Gutsy several weeks ago. It would
crash after running for about a day or so. While I still don't know what the
actual problem was, my [brother](https://thatsmathematics.com/blog/about-me/) and
I were able to solve the problem by downgrading to the previous version of the
Linux kernel. It now has uptime of over three days, which seems to indicate
that the problem has been fixed.
