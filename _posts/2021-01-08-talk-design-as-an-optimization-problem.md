I gave a talk at [Speakeasy JS](https://speakeasyjs.com/) in which I expanded upon the ideas I originally shared in my post [Mainlining Nostalgia: Making the Winamp Skin Museum](https://jordaneldredge.com/blog/winamp-skin-musuem). The talk discusses how my focus on performance unified both the engineering and design of the [Winamp Skin Museum](https://skins.webamp.org), and ultimately contributed to its success.
