This tag from the seminal [book of tags](http://www.stampedecitychorus.com/classic_tags_men2.pdf) seemed quite fitting to multitrack. This is "All By Myself Alone" number. I found that the lead part was actually easier for me to sing a whole step higher because the C was right in the middle of my [passagio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passaggio), and it was pushing sharp. So this one is in D.

Biggest challenges:

- Fan noise from my server and laptop
- Giving the music emotion without going out of tune
