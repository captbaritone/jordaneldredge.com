I got a new [Flip camcorder](http://www.theflip.com/products_flip_ultra.shtml) from [Woot.com](http://www.woot.com/) yesterday. To test it, I filmed myself singing "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" off by one word. By starting the song on a fictional pickup note, the alignment of the words and music gets off. So, I run out of words before I finish singing the melody which leaves the melody on the unresolved solfeggio "ti".

Update:

After I sang this for my friend and idol Paul Kim, he  recorded a version of himself doing it, complete with original midi backup:
