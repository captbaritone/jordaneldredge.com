Over the last few weeks, within a two block radius of my apartment, I have found three identical copies of this document. Does anybody know what the "Henry system of music transcription" is? Or how it reduces the need for page turns? Or why someone has been pamphlet-bombing my neighborhood with propaganda against it?
