[![Love is the Answer](/uploads/2008/05/picture-1-300x148.png "SF City College Hill")](/uploads/2008/05/picture-1.png)

For a long time the hill on the south side of the City College had a collection of boards on it that were arranged to spell "LOVE IS THE ANSWER." more recently, vandals/artists have started rearranging those boards to spell different things. Almost every time I walk from [Chelsea](http://www.chelseahollow.com)'s house to the bus, it has changed. For a while I thought it would make a cool art project to photgraph all the different things it says, but I have no camera. Today I had a great idea: I could tweet them! So from now on, you can find out what the hill is currently saying here: [https://twitter.com/sfcchill](https://twitter.com/sfcchill) (updated every time I pass it).
