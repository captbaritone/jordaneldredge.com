title: "Electric ukulele ring-tone for Chelsea"
---

While visiting my parents at their cabin just North of [Ukiah California](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukiah,_California), I wrote and recorded a ring-tone for [Chelsea](http://www.chelseahollow.com). The electric ukulele plugs directly into my battery operated [Zoom H4](/blog/in-dixie-land-where-i-was-born/) four track recorder, so the whole thing could be made in the middle of the woods.
