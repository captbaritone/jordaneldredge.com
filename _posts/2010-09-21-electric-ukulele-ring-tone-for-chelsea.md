While visiting my parents at their cabin just North of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukiah,_California">Ukiah California</a>, I wrote and recorded a ring-tone for <a href="http://www.chelseahollow.com">Chelsea</a>. The electric ukulele plugs directly into my battery operated <a href="http://blog.classicalcode.com/2009/05/in-dixie-land-where-i-was-born/">Zoom H4</a> four track recorder, so the whole thing could be made in the middle of the woods.
