With the advent of [limerickdb.com](http://www.limerickdb.com), which is full
of nerdy limericks because it was started by the author of xkcd, I was inspired
to author some nerdy limericks within my field of nerd-dom.

First the "Famous poem rewritten as a  limerick" type:

> A man held his boy by his side  
> as through the dark night he did ride.  
> The boy's health; it lessened,  
> The Erlkönig beckoned!  
> When they finally got home, the boy'd died.

And then the "Only funny to a small group of specific nerds" type:

> When singing the minor mode keys,  
> in F# you must mind your 'sis'.  
> Though vulgar and raw,  
> descending from 'la',  
> letter names are pronounced as: 'fees ees'.  

I have submitted them both, but have yet to see them appear on the site.

For more info on "Der Erlkönig" check out its
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Erlk%C3%B6nig) article, and
Fischer-Dieskau/Moore's performance of the [Schubert
song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5B6nysheec). Creepy.

__Update:__ I looks like my submissions to the database have been denied. Not
up to snuff?
