On July 14th I had the honor of being asked to sing Tom Waits' "Ol' 55" at the wedding of my dear friends Jared and Kathleen. To help commemorate that special day, I have made this simple documentation recording of the arrangement I sang. Thank you both for letting me be a part of your beautiful ceremony, and thank you to Mr. Waits' for writing this jewel.
