My idol, Paul Kim, put a few videos of my (our) choir on Youtube. He is the one singing the bass solo part in this one.

From Paul's Youtube description:

> San Francisco State University's choir concert, December 15, 2007 at Most
> Holy Redeember Church in the Castro. "1st Katisma" - from "Vigilia" by
> Einojuhani Rautavaara, sung in Finnish. Conducted by Dr. Joshua Habermann.

Thanks Paul!
