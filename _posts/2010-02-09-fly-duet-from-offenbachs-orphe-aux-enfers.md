To raise money for her graduate school audition tour, my girlfriend [Chelsea](http://www.chelseahollow.com) and the amazing pianist Stephen Damonte, put on a fundraiser recital. I joined her for the Fly Duet from Offenbach's <em>Orphée aux enfers</em> in which Jupiter disguised as a fly (myself) seduces the innocent Eurydice (Chelsea). If you want to help her achieve her goal of going to graduate school, you can [donate at her website](http://classicalcode.com/chelseahollow/?cat=9).
