On Tuesday I gave my very first talk. I've been attending the [San Francisco Vim
Enthusiasts] user group for a few months now, and was given the opportunity to
give a 20 minute "beginners" talk where I addressed two core concepts of Vim:

- Vim's normal mode is a language
- Embrace customization

Feel free to check out the [slides]. Their source is also on [GitHub].
