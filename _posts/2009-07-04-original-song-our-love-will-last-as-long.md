Yesterday, I was at [Donut World](http://maps.google.com/maps?oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=donut+world+sf&fb=1&split=1&gl=us&view=text&latlng=13147797873413706925) drinking a coffee, eating a buttermilk-bar and missing my [girlfriend](http://www.chelseahollow.com), when this little love song popped into my head. I quickly scrawled it on the back of a piece of paper I found in my pocket, went home and recorded it.
