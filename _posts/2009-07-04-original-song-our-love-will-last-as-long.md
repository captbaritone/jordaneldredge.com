Yesterday, I was at [Donut World](http://maps.google.com/maps?oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=donut+world+sf&amp;fb=1&amp;split=1&amp;gl=us&amp;view=text&amp;latlng=13147797873413706925) drinking a coffee, eating a buttermilk-bar and missing my [girlfriend](http://www.chelseahollow.com), when this little love song popped into my head. I quickly scrawled it on the back of a piece of paper I found in my pocket, went home and recorded it.

For Chelsea: "Our Love Will Last As Long"
