As well as turning 28, last month my brother graduated from UCSD with is PhD(!) in mathematics. So, as a combined gift, I got the family and Chelsea together to record a math themed song for him. We recorded "That's Mathematics" by [Tom Lehrer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Lehrer).

Happy birthday and congratulation Nathaniel. You are the best source of pride and inspiration a little brother cold ask for.
