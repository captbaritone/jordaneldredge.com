[edit]<strike> http://</strike>classicalcode.com [/edit] now belongs to me. (For a year). After being so disgusted with <a href="http://www.godaddy.com">godaddy</a> I decided to shop around for a domain name registrar with more respect for their customers. I ended up buying form a French registrar called <a href="http://www.gandi.com">Gandi</a> which I am very happy with. The cleanness of the website accurately depicts the cleaness of the purchase. Unlike godaddy.com they did not try to pressure or trick me into buying anything extra, and the process was quite straightforward. The cost ended up being 15 bucks for a year. Not too bad. In order to get the domain name to point to my server (the computer in my closet) I used a free DNS from <a href="http://www.zoneedit.com">Zone Edit</a> which was set up without too much pain. As I have cable internet, my ip address does change every now and again, so a daemon called <a href="http://ddclient.wiki.sourceforge.net/">ddclient</a> (pictured) checks what my external ip address is every five minutes and updates my Zone Edit account.

The current setup:
<ul>
	<li> <a href="http://music.classicalcode.com">http://music.classicalcode.com</a> points to my opera database</li>
	<li><a href="http://blog.classicalcode.com">http://blog.classicalcode.com</a> points to this blog</li>
</ul>
