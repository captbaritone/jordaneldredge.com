I have been growing weary of captbaritone.no-ip.info for some time (its very
hard to explain to people) I finally broke down a bought a domain name.
classicalcode.com now belongs to me. (For a year). After being so disgusted
with [godaddy](http://www.godaddy.com) I decided to shop around for a domain
name registrar with more respect for their customers. I ended up buying form
a French registrar called [Gandi](http://www.gandi.com) which I am very happy
with. The cleanness of the website accurately depicts the cleaness of the
purchase. Unlike godaddy.com they did not try to pressure or trick me into
buying anything extra, and the process was quite straightforward. The cost
ended up being 15 bucks for a year. Not too bad.

In order to get the domain name to point to my server (the computer in my
closet) I used a free DNS from [Zone Edit](http://www.zoneedit.com) which was
set up without too much pain. As I have cable internet, my ip address does
change every now and again, so a daemon called
[ddclient](http://ddclient.wiki.sourceforge.net/) (pictured) checks what my
external ip address is every five minutes and updates my Zone Edit account.

The current setup:

- [http://music.classicalcode.com](http://music.classicalcode.com) points to my opera database
- [http://blog.classicalcode.com](http://blog.classicalcode.com) points to this blog
