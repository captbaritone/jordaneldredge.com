title: Why linting errors should cause tests to fail
layout: post
summary: Making the case against allowing linting errors in master.
---

I recently had a discussion with a colleague who argued that:

> Linting errors should not block a pull request from being merged.

I found myself disagreeing vehemently but unable to clearly state why. I've
written this post to help clarify my thoughts on the position.

In this post I will attempt to convince you that a linting error should be
treated as equivalent to test failure, and should not be permitted in your
production branch.

## Some specifics

At [Hearsay Social](https://hearsaysocial.com/company/careers/engineering/) we
use [GitHub pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
to manage changes to our code base. When a pull request is opened, [Travis
CI](https://travis-ci.org) picks it up, and runs our test suite. The two
requirements for merging a pull request into master, our production branch,
are:

* Approval from one other engineer
* Passing Travis tests

We recently configured our Travis tests to include running
[ESLint](http://eslint.org/). This means that code that does not conform to our
linting standards cannot be merged into master. While my colleague and I were
both in agreement that linting is valuable, it was this change that sparked
debate.

## The simplified argument

My colleague's main point against including ESLint in Travis was that, in
a case where the site is down and we need to ship a hotfix, it would be
terrible for a misaligned curly brace to prevent merging the fix and thus
prolong our down-time.

I must admit that I agree with his premise. It is far more important to bring
the site back up than for master to be free of linting errors. However,
I disagree that removing linting from our test suite is the best way to address
this concern.

I would argue that in the case of a site-down hotfix, you should have
a mechanism for bypassing tests all together. There are many types of  of ways
in which tests test failures which should not be a blocker to shipping
a hotfix. For example:

* Transient test failures cause by not properly mocking out the system clock
* Test failures introduced by your package repository being down.

I don't think anyone would suggest disabling tests all together just to avoid
the possibility that one of these errors might block a hotfix.

If you don't have a system that can work around those types of failures, you
properly should. And if you _do_ have a system that can work around these
failures, it would be appropriate to use it to work around a hypothetical
misaligned curly brace.

## Why I care so much

By putting test failures on a pedestal above linting errors, I think we
underestimate the value of linting, and the harm that linting errors can cause.

Without enforcing your linting rules as part of your tests, you are guaranteed
to end up with linting errors merged into your master branch. Let's explore
three phases of a developer's workflow and see how they are negatively affected
by this choice.

### During code review

If a reviewer can operate under the assumption that the code they are reviewing
conforms to the project's linting rules, they don't need to manually lint the
code they are reading.

For example, if the reviewer sees that the author has removed a variable
definition, they can trust that the author did not overlook a later usage of
that variable. Without the linter's assurance, the reviewer would need to
manually check the entire file for other usages of that variable.

This applies to less overt errors as well. Did the author use the right number
of spaces when they indented? If tests were configured to fail on linting
errors, the reviewer wouldn't even need to ask herself that question, freeing
her mental bandwidth to focus on other, more substantial, questions.

### During deploy

In addition to testing for issues of style, linters check for code validity. We
should not deploy code that is invalid.

For example, calling `console.log` will cause your application to crash in
Internet Explorer 9. Despite this dire consequences, developers frequently
open pull requests with `console.log` statements leftover from debugging.
A linting rule like [`no-console`](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-console), if
enforced as part of your test suite, can give you complete confidence that you
will never encounter that particular bug in production.

### On a new feature branch

When a developer starts a new feature branch, they start their branch off of
master. This means they are starting their work on a branch that could already
have linting errors. When it's time for her to ship her changes she is now
forced to choose between cleaning up somebody else's mess, or leaving these
linting errors in master.

The presence of these errors also reinforces a mentality that such errors are
acceptable in master. While a single linting failure may seem quite harmless,
the precedence it sets can be terribly damaging.

Addison Wesley Longman puts it best in his description of the [broken window
theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory) in his book [The
Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer):

> One broken window, left unrepaired for any substantial length of time,
> instills in the inhabitants of the building a sense of abandonmentâ€”a sense
> that the powers that be don't care about the building.
>
> So another window gets broken. People start littering. Graffiti appears.
> Serious structural damage begins. In a relatively short space of time, the
> building becomes damaged beyond the owner's desire to fix it, and the sense
> of abandonment becomes reality.

## Conclusion

Like unit tests, the assertions your linting tool provides can be tremendously
valuable, but only if they are enforced in absolute terms and at the right
boundary. I believe that to derive the most value from a linting tool, an
organization must be steadfastly committed to not permitting linting errors to
be merged into production code.
