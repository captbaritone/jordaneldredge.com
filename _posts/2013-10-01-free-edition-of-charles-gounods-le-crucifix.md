About three months ago I began working on a [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org) edition of [Charles Gounod](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Gounod)‘s
a cappella choral work &#8220;Le Crucifix&#8221; with Richard Benefield, the
music director Old First Presbyterian Church where I am the bass section
leader.

Mr. Benefield edited the edition and I typeset it using [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org). Creating our own edition allowed us to
typeset Richard&#8217;s original English translation directly into the score
and had the side benefit of allowing us to release a high quality French
edition into the Creative Commons.
