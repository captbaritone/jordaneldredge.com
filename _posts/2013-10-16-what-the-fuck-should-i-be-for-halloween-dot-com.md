Yesterday I spent an hour building a website that suggests absurd sexy
halloween costume ideas. Just 24 hours later, it has received a surprising
amount of attention. You can find it at: [WhatTheFuckShouldIBeForHalloween.com](http://WhatTheFuckShouldIBeForHalloween.com)

Last year around this time, I had an idea for a halloween costume idea
generator that would play on the fact that halloween costumes have a reputation
for gratuitous sexuality. The idea was that you could prefix any non-sense noun
with the word &#8220;sexy&#8221; and make it a hilarious costume idea. It
turned out, that wasn&#8217;t quite true. Nouns, as a whole, are actually
pretty boring so I gave up.

This year, however, I remembered the idea and decided to try it with a list of
&#8220;funny&#8221; nouns. I trolled the internet for a list of funny nouns
and found nothing satisfactory, so I started my own. A half-hour later I had
a working prototype and decided it was funny enough to merit purchasing
a domain name. I had shamelessly cribbed the aesthetic (both comic and visual) from the hilarious [whatTheFuckShouldIMakeForDinner.com](http://www.whatthefuckshouldimakefordinner.com/) (big debt of gratitude to them, buy their [fucking cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0762441771/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0762441771&linkCode=as2&tag=wtfsibfc-20)) so I chose:

[WhatTheFuckShouldIBeForHalloween.com](http://WhatTheFuckShouldIBeForHalloween.com).

A few hours later I had the domain name pointed to my server. I wrote [a tweet about it](https://twitter.com/captbaritone/status/390245191472279552), posted a similar message on Facebook and went to dinner.

As of now, 24 hours later, the project has received:

* 1,200 Facebook likes surpassing the 1,000 like milestone which [fachme.com](http://fachme.com/), my previously most popular project,
recently reached after *two and a half years*.
* 44 Twitter mentions, including several media personalities with 10s of
thousands of followers
* 34,000 page views from 4,100 unique visitors

It has been just incredible to watch it spread like this first-hand. My
&#8220;publicity&#8221; consisted of 30 seconds of typing and the project has
already engaged thousands of people just a day after I started working on it!
I&#8217;m reminded how empowering the internet is. If you have an idea that
people want to share, you can reach the entire internet without having to spend
a cent.

I have released the source code for the site into the Public Domain. You can find it, and submit suggestions at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/captbaritone/whatthefuckshouldibeforhalloween).
