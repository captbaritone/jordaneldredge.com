A few days ago, I wrote a barbershop tag for my girlfriend [Chelsea](http://www.chelseahollow.com).

My multitrack of the tag (sung a half step lower than written):

My goal was to write a "bloom" type tag where all voices start on a single unison note, and travel in smooth contrary motion to the final chord. Some great examples of this kind of tag are [Cry](/blog/barbershop-multi-track-cry/) and [Sleepy Time](/blog/tag-sleepy-time-down-south/). I took this idea so its logical extreme by using almost entirely chromatic contrary motion. In fact, of the melodic intervals in the tag, 19 are half steps, 9 are whole steps and 2 are perfect fourths.

I made a little video that teaches you all the parts by ear:
