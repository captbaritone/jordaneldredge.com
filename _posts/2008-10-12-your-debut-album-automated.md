The internet has spawned a hilarious method for determining Your Debut Album and the results are surprisingly hilarious. It works like this:
<blockquote>1 - Go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random</a>
The first random Wikipedia article you get is the name of your band.

2 - Go to Random quotations: <a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/random.php3">http://www.quotationspage.com/random.php3</a>
The last four words of the very last quote of the page is the title of your first album.

If you want to do this again, you'll hit refresh to generate new quotes, because clicking the quotes link again will just give you the same quotes over and over again.

3 - Go to flickr's "explore the last seven days" <a href="http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days/">http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days/</a>
Third picture, no matter what it is, will be your album cover.

Put it all together, that's your debut album.</blockquote>
I found this very funny, so I wrote a quick and dirty script to automate the process, and I must say, seeing an actual image of the album only makes it funnier. <a href="http://www.classicalcode.com/album_cover/">Have your debut album automatically generated here</a>. Be patient though, it takes a second to get all the data and put it together. The images are fully bookmarkable/shareable and you can simply hit refresh to get a new one!

Let me know what you think in the comments.
