With <a href="http://www.chelseahollow.com">Chelsea</a> (my girlfriend) out of town, I decided to treat myself to a movie for the Fourth of July. After the movie, I sat in my car in the parking garage and decided to improvise/record a little song on my <a href="http://blog.classicalcode.com/?p=497">portable multitracking device</a>. In my typical fashion it ended up being 5 tracks, only 16 seconds long, and about it's self. Hopefully one day I'll be able to write real songs. Hopefully.

For Chelsea: "Parking Garage"
