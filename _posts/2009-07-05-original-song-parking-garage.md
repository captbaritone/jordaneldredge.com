title: "[Original Song] \"Parking Garage\""
---

With [Chelsea](http://www.chelseahollow.com) (my girlfriend) out of town, I decided to treat myself to a movie for the Fourth of July. After the movie, I sat in my car in the parking garage and decided to improvise/record a little song on my [portable multitracking device](/blog/in-dixie-land-where-i-was-born/). In my typical fashion it ended up being 5 tracks, only 16 seconds long, and about its self. Hopefully one day I'll be able to write real songs. Hopefully.

For Chelsea: "Parking Garage"
