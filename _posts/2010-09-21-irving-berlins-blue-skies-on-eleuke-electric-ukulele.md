I have been dreaming about [electric ukuleles](/blog/video-i-made-a-4-electric-ukulele/) for years
now, and have been dreaming with a passion ever since I found the [Eleuke](http://www.eleukeusa.com/) on Youtube. Well, I finally decided
to buy one and could not be happier. Here is my first video on my new tenor
Eleuke. The arrangement is based on (stolen from) a beautiful version I heard
on [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HeSS7-jW-E).
