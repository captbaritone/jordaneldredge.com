title: "My brother's minuet"
---

My [brother](http://thatsmathematics.com/) took a music course in his undergrad
and as part of his coursework wrote a minuet. Its been sitting on
the piano at home for some time, and a few days ago my parents, on the advice
of my aunt, suggested that I record it for my grandparents. So, without further
ado, here is "Minuet" by Nate Eldredge.

(Please excuse my pedantic playing, and the added <strike>upper</strike> lower
neighbor tone "embellishment" near the end of the first repetition of the "B"
section.)
