summary: A summary of the podcasts to which I subscribe.
---

These are the podcasts to which I subscribe. They are listed in the order that
I would listen to them if I had an unlistened to episode of each:

* [Idle Thumbs] - Smart, funny, media savvy people talk about video games and
  other media in general.
* [Dan Carlin's Hardcore History] - _Long_ in-depth podcasts exploring
  historical wars with amazing context, detail and compassion.
* [Common Sense with Dan Carlin] - Current events podcast hosted by a hugely
  insightful historian/journalist.
* [Security Now] - Excellently explained in-depth news and deep-dives into
  computer security topics. The hosts are unfortunately slimy and you will
  want to be able to skip the _very_ long ad reads.
* [Risky Business] - Fast paced and fun security news and discussions.
* [Talk Python to Me] - Beautifully produced, compassionate and insightful
  interviews with fascinating people in the Python community.
* [JavaScript Air] - Excellent interviews with people in the JavaScript
  community. Great way to stay up on JavaScript news.
* [JavaScript Jabber] - Panel interviews with people in the JavaScript
  community.
* [Song Exploder] - Interviews with musicians in which they dissect a song and
  explain how it came to be the way it is.
