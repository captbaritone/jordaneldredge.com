These are the podcasts to which I subscribe. They are listed in the order that
I would listen to them if I had an unlistened to episode of each:

* [Idle Thumbs]: Smart, funny, media-savy people talk about video games and
  other media in general.
* [Dan Carlin's Hardcore History]: _Long_ in-depth podcasts exploring
  historical wars with amazing context, detail and compassion.
* [Common Sense with Dan Carlin]: Current events podcast hosted by a hugely
  insightful historian/journalist.
* [Security Now]: Excellently explained in-depth news and deep-dives into
  computer security topics. The hosts are unfortuenatly slimely and you will
  want to be able to skip the _very_ long ad reads.
* [Talk Python to Me]: Beautifully produced, compasionate and insightful
  inverviews with facinating people in the Python community.
* [JavaScript Air]: Excellent interviews with people in the JavaScript
  community. Great way to stay up on JavaScript news.
* [JavaScript Jabber]: Panel interviews with people in the JavaScript
  community.
* [Song Exploder]: Interviews with musicians in which they disect a song and
  explain how it came to be the way it is.
