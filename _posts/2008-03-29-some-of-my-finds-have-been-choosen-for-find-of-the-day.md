<a href="http://www.foundmagazine.com">www.foundmagazine.com</a>, the website of the Found Magazine (hard to believe I know) has a "Find of the Day" feature. Quite a while ago, I submitted several of my finds for consideration. As of now, four of them have been chosen. They are not my most interesting finds, but the large community which reads these finds, have left numerous comments.
<ul>
