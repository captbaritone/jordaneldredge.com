title: "Alvin sings Schumann's Widmung"

When I was taking Vocal Literature from <a href="http://www.sfsu.edu/~music/patty/faculty.html#deeter">Dr. Alissa Deeter</a>, she mentioned that for some reason when she thought of the song "Widmung" by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Schumann">Robert Schumann</a>, she always thought of it being sung by the Chipmunks. It took me some time, but about a year ago, I got around to making her crazy thoughts a reality, and recorded just that: a Chipmunk's Widmung. I then emailed her telling her I "found it." I have been told she did not realize I had made it until she played it for her class, who gave up the secret.

Here, it is for your enjoyment:
