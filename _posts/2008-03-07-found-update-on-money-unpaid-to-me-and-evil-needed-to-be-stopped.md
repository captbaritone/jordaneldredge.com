Quotes: "There will be no more possible options of prostitution..." and "The Sex Bumpmobile 'Last Option' on Girls Lives was shut down by me weeks ago".

> * Any and all money owed to me has still not been paid to me and I continue to suffer from being broke on the streets
> * Many people must be lying and saying they have paid me because this seems to be a surprise to many
> * The Sex Bumpmobile 'Last Option' on Girls Lives was shut down by me weeks ago because nobody ever brought the money owed to me by 6pm the next day.
> *There will be no more possible options of prostitution as a way for people to make money to pay what they owe me; I never approved of this option, instead people insisted on it - Now It Is Option Over
> * I am still always waiting, usually around Telegraph Ave, Berkely, Market St, SF, or Downtown Oakland (Santa Cruz, Pacific Ave Dec 28 - Jan 5) to be paid money owed to me
> * There are now people doing evil and sex cult rituals having stolen cocaine and money owed (+ other things of mine) to me and using themselves --
> * I never approved nor would have approved of this behavior and it has been causing me and many others intense suffering - Please Stop Them All By Any Means Necessary!
