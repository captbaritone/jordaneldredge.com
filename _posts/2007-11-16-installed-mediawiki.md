In a fit of curiosity, I installed
[MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) on my server. Its
basically the engine that [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)
uses. So now I have my own wiki! Horray! What I would ever use it for? I have
no idea.

So, if you are looking for a wiki to spam, try [Classical Code
Wiki](http://www.classicalcode.com/wiki/) (AKA "Test")
