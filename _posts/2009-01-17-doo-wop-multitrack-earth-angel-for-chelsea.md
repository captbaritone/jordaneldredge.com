My girlfriend is sick, so I arranged and recorded her a song. I hope this helps you feel better Chelsea.

For [Chelsea](http://www.chelseahollow.com):

This is my first doo-wop arrangement, and the first full song that I have multitracked. Unfortunately with five tracks at once, the noise on the recording becomes rather annoying. If anyone could help me reduce the noise, I would greatly appreciate it. I plan to write up the arrangement in the next few days (as an exercise) so you can expect to find that soon.

<strong>Update:</strong>

I typeset the arrangement using [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org/web/), a wonderful open source program for engraving music. Here are the results:
