Here is a tag I wrote, and multi-tracked, as a custom ring tone for my cell phone.

The text:
<blockquote>Hello, hello hello hello! Hello, you phone is ringin'. Hello, that's why I'm singin': "Hello." (Pick up your, cell, phone!)</blockquote>
The tag: 

<audio id="wp_mep_51" src="{{ site.url }}/uploads/2008/03/hello-mp3.mp3" type="audio/mp3"    controls="controls" preload="none"  ></audio>
