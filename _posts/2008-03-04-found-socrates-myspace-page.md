[![Found: Socrates Myspace Page](/uploads/2008/02/photo-0009.thumbnail.jpg)](/uploads/2008/02/photo-0009.jpg "Found: Socrates Myspace Page") My friend [Ben](http://www.thesublimelight.com) found this, and because he knows I collect these things, he gave it to me. It is a detailed drawing of what Socrates' Myspace page would look like. Highlights: He is friends with the SF Giants. He has 583 friends, his web page is [http://www.socratesrules.com](http://www.socratesrules.com). The person he would most like to meet is God. As always, click to enlarge image.
