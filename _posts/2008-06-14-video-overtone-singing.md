Inspired by [several](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtsjKPqKgzg) [examples](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFWYSW4vfcA&amp;feature=related) on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKK5I9_LFZM&amp;feature=related), and my curiosity about the subject, I attempted to do some non-throat-singing overtone singing. I was surprised that I was able to get the results I did.

Things I learned:

* Higher notes work better for me.
* The more closed my mouth is the clearer the overtones are heard
