Inspired by [several](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtsjKPqKgzg) [examples](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFWYSW4vfcA&feature=related) on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKK5I9_LFZM&feature=related), and my curiosity about the subject, I attempted to do some non-throat-singing overtone singing. I was surprised that I was able to get the results I did.

Things I learned:

- Higher notes work better for me.
- The more closed my mouth is the clearer the overtones are heard
