I head an old [NPR interview](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11858836) with Lyle Ritz about his album "No Frills" where he recorded several jazz standards in Garage Band over synthesized bass lines he entered himself. It was so clean, approachable, and free of pretension that it inspired me to fire up Garage Band and record this song I have been playing with for a while now.
