As software developers our profession is automating systems. The moment
I realized that my job itself was a system ripe for automation was
transformative.

Unfortunately, I often notice parts of my workflow that need improvement when I'm on
a tight deadline, or deep in code. So how do I keep these "bugs" from going
unfixed?

I have found a solution that works well for me: I started an issue tracker for
my workflow. I use the issue tracker on the GitHub repository for my
[dotfiles](https://github.com/captbaritone/dotfiles).

### Benefits

- It's easy to jot down problems knowing you can come back to them later
- If you write down your solution when you close the issue, future Googlers
  will benefit from your effort.
