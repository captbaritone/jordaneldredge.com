title: "\"Lazy Afternoon\" Barbershop Tag"
---

<p style="text-align: left;">The other day I was sitting on the couch with [my girlfriend](http://www.chelseahollow.com), and for a moment I felt completely at peace. I wrote and recorded this tag for that simple moment, and the the company in which I spent it.</p>
