Combining my <a href="http://blog.classicalcode.com/?p=32">love of nerdy limericks</a> and my <a href="http://blog.classicalcode.com/?cat=61">love of barbershop tags</a>, I have endeavored to create a limerick which teaches a barbershop tag. This tag was taught to me as Lilly Marlane, although I had to omit the words and a lead pickup note to fit it in the poetic format.

> First the lead posts the tonic, a C.  
> Then the others, homophonically:  
> Bass: re mi fa do,  
> Bari: la la le so.  
> While the tenor sings: fa mi re mi.
