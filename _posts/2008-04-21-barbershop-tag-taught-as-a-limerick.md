Combining my [love of nerdy limericks](/blog/music-nerd-limericks/) and my [love of barbershop tags](/tag/barbershop), I have endeavored to create a limerick which teaches a barbershop tag. This tag was taught to me as Lilly Marlane, although I had to omit the words and a lead pickup note to fit it in the poetic format.

> First the lead posts the tonic, a C.  
> Then the others, homophonically:  
> Bass: re mi fa do,  
> Bari: la la le so.  
> While the tenor sings: fa mi re mi.
