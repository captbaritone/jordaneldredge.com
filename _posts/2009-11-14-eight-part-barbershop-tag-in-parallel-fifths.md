title: "Eight-Part Barbershop Tag In Parallel Fifths"
---

I have recently observed, [on Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TbBZkh9PIs), a very interesting method of turning any barbershop tag into a jazzy eight part tag: simply double each part a perfect fifth higher. Or, said another way, have a second quartet simultaneously sing the same tag a fifth above.

Despite [everything I was taught in college](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consecutive_fifths), I have been curious to try this myself. However, due to sound bleed-through from my upstairs neighbors, I can't really record in my apartment these days. So I multitracked this one tonight in my car on my [Zoom H4](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LGA2K6?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=winterjourna-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000LGA2K6). Although I am sure I looked quite suspicious, I think it was worth it.

You can hear the original four part arrangement [here](/blog/in-dixie-land-where-i-was-born/).

I present to you "In Dixie Land Where I Was Born" from David Wright's collection: _[Classic Tags for Men's Voices](http://www.stampedecitychorus.com/classic_tags_men2.pdf)_ in parallel fifths:

**Update:** I have typeset the complete octet in the key of "C" as a [pdf file](/uploads/2009/11/eight-part-dixie-land-tag.pdf) and also generated a [midi file](/uploads/2009/11/eight-part-dixie-land-tag.midi).
