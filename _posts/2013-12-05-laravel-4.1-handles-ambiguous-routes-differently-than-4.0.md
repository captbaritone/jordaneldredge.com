title: "Laravel 4.1 handles ambiguous routes differently than 4.0"
tags: ["php", "laravel"]

After upgrading from Laravel 4.0 to 4.1 some of my routes mysteriously stopped
working. It turns out I had some ambiguity in my routes and how those
ambiguities are handled changed in 4.1.

My 4.0 setup looked like this:

```php
Route::get('file/{file}.mp3', 'FileController@mp3');
Route::get('file/{file}', 'FileController@show');
```

Since the `{file}` wild card is not completely separated by slashes, requests
for the first route _could_ be matched by the second route. In 4.0, I had to
have them in this order for mp3 requests to be matched correctly.

In Laravel 4.1 the matching order must have changed, because mp3 requests were
being matched by the generic file route. Putting the mp3 route after the
generic file route seemed to fix the problem.

Ultimately, I decided that I shouldn't be depending on how Laravel handles
ambiguous routes, so I changed the mp3 route to `file/mp3/{file}.mp3` which
behaves correctly independent of the order.

**Update:** (Dec 5th, 2013) I sent a [tweet][1] to @laravelphp asking if this was
a known change. It was a bug, and has been fixed in the most recent version.
