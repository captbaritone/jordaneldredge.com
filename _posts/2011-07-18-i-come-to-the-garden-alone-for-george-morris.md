Years after my grandfather died, my grandmother reconnected with an old friend from Ohio. George was an old family friend and a widower. A youthful romance followed. I will always remember George's kindness, good humor and most of all the spry young love he had for my grandmother Wanda.

I arranged this mostly as a way to spend some time alone with my memories of George. Whenever I think of George and Wanda, I think of the beautiful garden they kept together. I sang this hymn at my Grandmother's memorial service so it seemed like a fitting tribute to George.

This video was recorded in my backyard here in San Francisco.

Hymn: "In The Garden"

By Charles Austin Miles
Arranged and played by Jordan Eldredge
In honor of George Morris.

Lyrics:

> I come to the garden alone  
> While the dew is still on the roses  
> And the voice I hear falling on my ear  
> The Son of God discloses.

> And He walks with me, and He talks with me,  
> And He tells me I am His own;  
> And the joy we share as we tarry there,  
> None other has ever known.

> He speaks, and the sound of His voice,  
> Is so sweet the birds hush their singing,  
> And the melody that He gave to me  
> Within my heart is ringing.
