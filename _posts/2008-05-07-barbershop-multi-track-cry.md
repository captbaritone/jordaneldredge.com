Inspired by [these](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imHoaelEzOc&feature=related) [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUkWlxyV4Zw) [videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mk-AtNLfrM), I taught my friends the Cry tag, by Brian Beck, from the [ubiquitous tag book](http://www.stampedecitychorus.com/classic_tags_men2.pdf) (number 14). This tag is especially fun because it works in almost any key, high or low. Here is my multi-track version in G#-ish. I am thinking of calling my multi-track quartet "Jortet"!
