title: "Mary Had a Little Lamb - Parallel Fifths"

Inspired on my <a href="../2009/11/eight-part-barbershop-tag-in-parallel-fifths/">previous experimentation</a> with parallel fifth harmonies, and my new ukulele (more on that soon), my dad and I recorded this version of Mary Had a Little Lamb where I sang and played the same song a fifth above. He was playing his guitar and singing in the key of C, and I was playing my ukulele and and singing in the key of G.
