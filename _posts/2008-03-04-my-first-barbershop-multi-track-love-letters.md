On Chamber Singers tour to ACDA some other guys and myself (currently called Four Sweaty Guys in a Practice Room) started singing some [barbershop tags](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_%28Barbershop%29), which lead Paul to show me [this](http://www.stampedecitychorus.com/classic_tags_men2.pdf) great online collection in .pdf format. Now that we are back, I had a chance to play though a bunch of them on the piano with Jason Pano, and we found this gem: "Love Letters Straight From the Heart"

The .pdf file says it was written by Fred King in 1981 and was sung by the Pros And Cons.

I thought it would be ideal candidate for my first barbershop multi-track. So, here you all go:
