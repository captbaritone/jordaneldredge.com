<strong>EDIT (May 18, 2012): FML has changed their API to require a key, I have written them asking for such a key.</strong>

After experiencing the joy of following every [FMyLife.com](http://www.fmylife.com) entry with a trip to [SadTrombone.com](http://www.sadtrombone.com) I decided to throw together a mash up.

<a href="http://www.classicalcode.com/projects/sadtrombonemylife/" target="_blank">Sad Trombone My Life</a> serves up endless doses of [schadenfreude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude) with comedy brass chasers.
