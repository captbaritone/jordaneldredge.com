title: "Only the first and last letters of a word need be in the right place"

After my dad showed me an article in the [Funny
Times](http://www.funnytimes.com/) about how the only letters that really
matter when we read are the first and last, I thought it would be fun to write
a little script to scramble the inner letters of words.
