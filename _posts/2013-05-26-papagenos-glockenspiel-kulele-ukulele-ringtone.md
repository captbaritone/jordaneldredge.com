Chelsea is out of town again, and the [previous](/blog/the-surprise-slide-ukulele-micro-song/) [ringtones](/blog/electric-ukulele-ring-tone-for-chelsea/) I recorded for her are probably starting to get on her nerves, so I spent yesterday and today recording her a new one. This one is an electric ukulele/bass arrangement of the glockenspiel music Papageno plays to protect himself, and Pamina, from Monostatos in Mozart's _[Die Zauberfl√∂te](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_Flute)_ (_The Magic Flute_).

The recording consists of four tracks with the melody trading off between the first two. The harmonics proved too hard for me to play in real time, so I recorded only a few measures at a time, and pasted them together in post production:

1. Electric ukulele melody 1
2. Electric ukulele melody 2 (harmonics)
3. Electric ukulele chords
4. Electric bass
