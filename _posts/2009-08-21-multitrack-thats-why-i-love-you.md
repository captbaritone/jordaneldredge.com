[![The Flamingos: "I Only Have Eyes For You"](/uploads/2009/08/1996-cd-coverbig-310.jpg "The Flamingos: I Only Have Eyes For You")](http://www.amazon.com/I-Only-Have-Eyes-You/dp/B000005MWW)

I recorded this song as a surprise for my wonderful girlfriend [Chelsea](http://www.chelseahollow.com).

As far as I can tell, this song is originally by one of my very favorite musical groups: [The Flamingos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flamingos). I heard it on their album [_I Only Have Eyes For You_](http://www.amazon.com/I-Only-Have-Eyes-You/dp/B000005MWW) and thought it would be the perfect one to try to record. After hours and hours of transcription, recording, rerecording and level-twiddling, it's finally presentable.

For Chelsea: An a cappella version of "That's Why I Love You" by the Flamingos:
