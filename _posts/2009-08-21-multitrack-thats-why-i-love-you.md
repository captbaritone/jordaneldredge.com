I recorded this song as a surprise for my wonderful girlfriend <a href="http://www.chelseahollow.com">Chelsea</a>.

As far as I can tell, this song is originally by one of my very favorite musical groups: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flamingos">The Flamingos</a>. I heard it on their album <a href="http://www.amazon.com/I-Only-Have-Eyes-You/dp/B000005MWW"><em>I Only Have Eyes For You</em></a> and thought it would be the perfect one to try to record. After hours and hours of transcription, recording, rerecording and level-twiddling, it's finally presentable.

For Chelsea: An a cappella version of "That's Why I Love You" by the Flamingos:
