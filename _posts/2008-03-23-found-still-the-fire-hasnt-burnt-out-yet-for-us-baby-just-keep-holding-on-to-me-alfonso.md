I don't remember exactly where this came from, but I have a vague recollection of someone (other then myself) finding it at a beach, and giving it to me. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Possibly when I was at [OperaWorks](http://www.operaworks.com/). If anyone remembers, let me know.</span>

_Edit: Chelsea reminded me that she found it in the water on the beach when we were in Aruba last year_

This is an intense love letter to Alfonso. From the letter: "still, the fire hasn't burnt out yet for us Baby, just keep holding on to me Alfonso"

Because the photo I took is such poor quality, I have transcribed it here below:
