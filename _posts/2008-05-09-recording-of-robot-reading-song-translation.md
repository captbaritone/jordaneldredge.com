Last semester, when I was still a member of the SFSU Chamber Singers, I was asked to read a translation before one of our songs. In my effort to have the words be understood, I ended up reading it very lifelessly. So lifelessly that it became the butt of jokes. Following the old adage "If you can't beat 'em join 'em" Paul Kim and I teamed up to perform the ultimate parody, which we assaulted our conductor Josh Habermann with on the bus. It was not recorded, so today I sat down and multi-tracked a recreation of that fine moment.

The song I was translating is the first in this set:
