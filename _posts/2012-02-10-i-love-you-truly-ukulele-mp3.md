title: "I Love You Truly [Ukulele Mp3]"
---

With [Chelsea](http://chelseahollow.com) traveling all over the country on her graduate school auditions I had both the time and motivation to record her a little song. Although this one is not original, it is the same style as the [two](/blog/electric-ukulele-ring-tone-for-chelsea/) [previous](/blog/the-surprise-slide-ukulele-micro-song/) ring tones I made for her. The song has four electric ukulele tracks and one electric bass track.

The song is "[I Love You Truly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Love_You_Truly)" a 1901 song by [Carrie Jacobs Bond](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Jacobs_Bond "Carrie Jacobs Bond").Â The lyrics (which are not present in this recording) are as follows:

> I love you truly, truly dear,  
> Life with its sorrow, life with its tears  
> Fades into dreams when I feel you are near  
> For I love you truly, truly dear.  

> Ah! Love, 'tis something to feel your kind hand  
> Ah! Yes, 'tis something by your side to stand;  
> Gone is the sorrow, gone doubt and fear,  
> For you love me truly, truly dear.
