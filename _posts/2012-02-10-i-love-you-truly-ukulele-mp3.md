With <a href="http://chelseahollow.com">Chelsea</a> traveling all over the country on her graduate school auditions I had both the time and motivation to record her a little song. Although this one is not original, it is the same style as the <a href="http://blog.classicalcode.com/2010/09/electric-ukulele-ring-tone-for-chelsea/">two</a> <a href="http://blog.classicalcode.com/2011/05/the-surprise-slide-ukulele-micro-song/">previous</a> ring tones I made for her. The song has four electric ukulele tracks and one electric bass track.
