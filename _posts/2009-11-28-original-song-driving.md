As of this week, [Chelsea](http://www.chelseahollow.com) and I have been going out for three years and after countless [barbershop tags](/blog/barbershop-multi-track-happy-anniversary-chelsea/), [covers](/blog/multitrack-thats-why-i-love-you/) and [miniature songs](/blog/original-song-our-love-will-last-as-long/) I have finally been able to write her an honest-to-goodness _song_ song. I'll admit it's cheesy and trite and doesn't properly rhyme, but it's a song. A real song. Finally.

For Chelsea, after three years: "Driving"

Lyrics:

> I had to get to UPS to pick up a pair of boots.  
> You offered to give me a lift if I'd buy you a beer.  
> So we went driving in your car, though it wasn't very far,  
> We got lost and laughed at all the things we would become.
>
> You had to wake up before dawn to help your friend catch a flight.  
> I tagged along just to be with you in the early morning light.  
> So we went driving in your car, underneath the stars.  
> Then we went up the hill and watched the sunrise though the fog.
>
> Now you've sold your car and bought a bike though the pedals made you sacred.  
> And my parents gave me their old car which I share with you.  
> Now we go driving in my car, which we never could before.  
> And it isn't much but it's an excuse to be close to you
