Last Mother's Day I recorded my mom a [barbershop tag](/blog/barbershop-multi-track-mothers-day-gift/). This Mother's Day caught me at a bad time, and I was gift-less when I saw her. So today, with my [new recording equipment](/blog/in-dixie-land-where-i-was-born/), I recorded a belated Mother's Day barbershop tag. I have always thought this tag was particularly beautiful and have attempted it a few times before with little success. This time I feel like I have finally been able to do it some measure of justice.

Happy (belated) Mothers Day Lisa. I could not ask for a better mama.
