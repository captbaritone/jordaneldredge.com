Yet another song from the vaults. This one from February 14th, 2006. One of only few serious original songs I have written.

Lyrics:

> I walked out the door and followed my feet and wished for it all to leave.  
> My head was too full, no way to digest, the thoughts you had left me with.  
> So I paced round the pond, and muttered of love, and tore my hair out from within.  
> There were tears that time round, and the time after that, and walking away never helped.  
> So I pace every night to try to forget. But it always just brings me back home.

Recorded on my first ukulele into my first (MacBook) laptop.
