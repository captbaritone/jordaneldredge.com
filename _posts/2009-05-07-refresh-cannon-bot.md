The awesome nerd over at [Geoff's Boring Programming Stuff](http://geoff.greer.fm/) gave me the biggest compliment a programmer could recieve. [He wrote a program](http://geoff.greer.fm/2009/05/05/refresh-cannon-bot/) to use [my program](/blog/refresh-cannon/)! As he points out in his post, it seems pretty clear that he is not the only one. If there is anything more rewarding than that, I can't think what it would be. Thanks Geoff.

**Edit:** (May 18th, 2009)

Apparently my brother's room mate took at shot a writting a bot of his own. You can see his progress [here](http://banach.ucsd.edu/RefreshCannon/) and his wins [here](http://banach.ucsd.edu/RefreshCannon/wins.php).
