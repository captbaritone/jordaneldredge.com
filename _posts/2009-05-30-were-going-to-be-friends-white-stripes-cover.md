Inspired by the [recording I made with my friends](/blog/alice-n-the-irving-street-kidz/), I decided to record a non-[barbershop](http://blog.classicalcode.com/category/music/barbershop/) song. I decided on "Were Going To Be Friends" by the White Stripes. I recorded in four passes, each of which required several takes. First the ukulele track, which almost gave me carpel tunnel, then the melody, and then two different harmony tracks. The harmonies were based on a harmony I remember my friend Rosie Steffy singing when she first introduced me to this song many years ago.

Have a listen to this cover of the White Stripe's "Were Going To Be Friends":
