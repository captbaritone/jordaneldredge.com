Years ago I heard a beautiful arrangement of Charlie Chaplin's
"[Smile](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile_(Charlie_Chaplin_song)>)" on [Ukuele Mike’s Youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/MusicTeacher2010). Unfortunately the video is no-longer online.
However, his arrangement inspired me to create my own using his as a starting
point.

My goal was an arrangement which exposed the simplistic beauty of the
song&#8217;s timeless melody. Unfortunately while trying to expose the melody
I inadvertently exposed my amateur technique. That&#8217;s why it has taken
several years (4-5?) of idle practice to get this piece to a place where it was
fit to record. I hope you enjoy listening to this recording as much as I have
enjoy playing it for the last several years:

The lyrics to the song are not used in this recording but are none-the-less
an important part of this song:

> Smile, though your heart is aching
> Smile, even though it’s breaking
> When there are clouds in the sky
> you’ll get by
> If you smile through your fear and sorrow
> Smile and maybe tomorrow
> You’ll see the sun come shining through
> for you

> Light up your face with gladness
> Hide every trace of sadness
> Although a tear may be ever so near
> That’s the time you must keep on trying
> Smile what’s the use of crying
> You’ll find that life is still worthwhile
> If you’ll just
> Smile
