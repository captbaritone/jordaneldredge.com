I learned a good deal from the "imperfections" of [my first barbershop
multi-track](/blog/my-first-barbershop-multi-track-love-letters/)
and was anxious to try another one to put this knowledge to use. So I did.

The improvements I made were:

- More natural vowels
- Better tuning
- More head voice (less pushed tone)
- Better blend

Areas that I still wish to improve are:

- More natural consonants
- Cleaner tuning of leaps
- Cleaner cut offs for breaths (unashamed)

As before the music is from [this](http://www.stampedecitychorus.com/classic_tags_men2.pdf) (No. 98) great collection of barbershop tags. However this time, neither the
arranger nor the quartet are cited.
