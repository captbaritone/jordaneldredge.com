title: "Barbershop multi-track: Lord, You Made the Night Too Long"
layout: post

I learned a good deal from the "imperfections" of [my first barbershop
multi-track](/blog/my-first-barbershop-multi-track-love-letters/)
and was anxious to try another one to put this knowledge to use. So I did.

The improvements I made were:

* More natural vowels
* Better tuning
* More head voice (less pushed tone)
* Better blend

Areas that I still wish to improve are:

* More natural consonants
* Cleaner tuning of leaps
* Cleaner cut offs for breaths (unashamed)

As before the music is from <a
href="http://www.stampedecitychorus.com/classic_tags_men2.pdf">this</a> (No.
98) great collection of barbershop tags. However this time, neither the
arranger nor the quartet are cited.
