I learned a good deal from the "imperfections" of <a href="http://blog.classicalcode.com/?p=57">my first barbershop multi-track</a> and was anxious to try another one to put this knowledge to use. So I did.

The improvements I made were:
<ul>
	<li>More natural vowels</li>
	<li>Better tuning</li>
	<li>More head voice (less pushed tone)</li>
	<li>Better blend</li>
</ul>
Areas that I still wish to improve are:
<ul>
	<li>More natural consonants</li>
	<li>Cleaner tuning of leaps</li>
	<li>Cleaner cut offs for breaths (unashamed)</li>
</ul>
As before the music is from <a href="http://www.stampedecitychorus.com/classic_tags_men2.pdf">this</a> (No. 98) great collection of barbershop tags. However this time, neither the arranger nor the quartet are cited.
