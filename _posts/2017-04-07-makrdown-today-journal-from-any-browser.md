For the last three months, on and off, I've been working on a journaling web application. It solves my own journaling needs, maybe it would be useful to you as well.

It assumes the following:

- You want to keep your journal as a Markdown file.
- You have a Dropbox account.
- You want to be able to write in your journal from any browser.
- You want the option to encrypt your journal file before leaves your browser.
- You are willing to trust my open-source JavaScript.

You can try it at <https://markdown.today>.

Source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/captbaritone/markdown.today).
