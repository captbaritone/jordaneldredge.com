My (now ex) choir just toured to Anaheim, Souther California, to sing for
a choral conductors' convention, <a href="http://www.acdaonline.org/">ACDA</a>.
It is a huge honor for our choir to be invited to sing here. Here is a clip
from a pre-convention concert we gave in <a
href="http://www.rc.net/orange/stboniface/">St. Boniface</a>.

From Paul Kim's description of the video:

> San Francisco State University Chamber Singers under the direction of Dr.
> Joshua Habermann sings Rosas Pandan, a traditional Filipino folksong arranged
> by George Hernandez, performed at St Boniface Church in Anaheim on Feb 26,
> 2008. Sung in Visayan about the beautiful maiden Rosas Pandan.
