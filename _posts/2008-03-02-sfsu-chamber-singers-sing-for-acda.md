My (now ex) choir just toured to Anaheim, Souther California, to sing for
a choral conductors' convention, [ACDA](http://www.acdaonline.org/).
It is a huge honor for our choir to be invited to sing here. Here is a clip
from a pre-convention concert we gave in [St. Boniface](http://www.rc.net/orange/stboniface/).

From Paul Kim's description of the video:

> San Francisco State University Chamber Singers under the direction of Dr.
> Joshua Habermann sings Rosas Pandan, a traditional Filipino folksong arranged
> by George Hernandez, performed at St Boniface Church in Anaheim on Feb 26, 2008. Sung in Visayan about the beautiful maiden Rosas Pandan.
