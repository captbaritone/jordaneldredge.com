My all-time favorite finds are these three, which I found [here](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=sf&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=37.784605,-122.458119&amp;spn=0.006817,0.013711&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=37.7812,-122.45887&amp;cbp=1,566.3613579897253,,0,7.719995925626088) on Arguello. They were folded into paper airplanes.

The following links are most likely "Not Safe For Work".
