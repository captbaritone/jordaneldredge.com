My all-time favorite finds are these three, which I found [here](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=sf&ie=UTF8&ll=37.784605,-122.458119&spn=0.006817,0.013711&z=16&layer=c&cbll=37.7812,-122.45887&cbp=1,566.3613579897253,,0,7.719995925626088) on Arguello. They were folded into paper airplanes.

The following links are most likely "Not Safe For Work".
