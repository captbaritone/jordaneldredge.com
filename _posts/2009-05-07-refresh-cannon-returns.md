My simple <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/refresh-cannon/">Refresh Cannon</a> game got picked up by <a href="http://waxy.org/links/archive/2009/05/index.shtml">several</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wykop.pl/link/178906/interaktywna-gra-w-obrazku-png">high</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.superlevel.de%2F&sl=de&tl=en&hl=en&ie=UTF-8">traffic</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://sacrej.eu/index.php/2009/05/06/refresh-cannon/">websites</a>. Unfortunately the large volume of traffic brought my simple server to its knees, so I had to take the link to the image down. Now that the bulk of the traffic seems to have passed, I am reposting the link. You can find it at the <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/refresh-cannon/">original post</a>.
