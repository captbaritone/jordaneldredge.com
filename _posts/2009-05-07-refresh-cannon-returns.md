My simple [Refresh Cannon](/blog/refresh-cannon/) game got picked up by [several](http://waxy.org/links/archive/2009/05/index.shtml)&nbsp;[high](http://www.wykop.pl/link/178906/interaktywna-gra-w-obrazku-png)&nbsp;[traffic](http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.superlevel.de%2F&sl=de&tl=en&hl=en&ie=UTF-8)&nbsp;[websites](http://sacrej.eu/index.php/2009/05/06/refresh-cannon/). Unfortunately the large volume of traffic brought my simple server to its knees, so I had to take the link to the image down. Now that the bulk of the traffic seems to have passed, I am reposting the link. You can find it at the [original post](/blog/refresh-cannon/).
