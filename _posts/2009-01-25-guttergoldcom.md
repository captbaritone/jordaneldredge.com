**Edit (May 18, 2012): This project is no-longer online.**

Since [my brother](https://thatsmathematics.com/blog/about-me/) introduced me to [Found Magazine](http://foundmagazine.com/) several years ago, watching the gutter and sidewalk for interesting things has become a hobby of mine. Unfortunately I was never able to find a good website on which to post the things I found. Found Magazine has an online section called "Find of the Day" but it only allows tiny images, and the wait to get your finds posted is interminable. Fed up, I designed, coded and published my own solution to this internet shortcoming. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you: [GutterGold.com](http://www.guttergold.com). Feel free to peruse, rate and comment upon my finds, subscribe to the RSS feed, or post some of your own finds. Also: tell your friends!
