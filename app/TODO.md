# Things to improve

- [ ] Notes pages do not seem to be revalidating ever, even on restart of the app!?
- [ ] unstable_cache does not seem to prevent the functions from getting called multiple times
- [ ] Serialize notes to disk (no pure NextJS way to make a script to do this)
- [ ] Consider defining descriptions for each tag
- [ ] Rework search
  - [ ] Avoid loading suspense
  - [ ] Server rendered?
  - [ ] Keyboard controls
  - [ ] Icon in the nav bar
- [ ] Improve layout of projects page
- [ ] Expose GraphQL server? (why?)
- [ ] Add notes to RSS feed?
- [ ] Provide sitemap?
