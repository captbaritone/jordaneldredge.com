Hello! My name is Jordan Eldredge. I am a programmer and classical singer
living in San Francisco with my wife, and fellow singer, [Chelsea
Hollow](http://chelseahollow.com).

## Programming

I've been writing software as a hobby since I was in High School. After
college, it evolved naturally into a career. Since about 2009 I have been
a full-time freelance web developer.

If you are looking for help with your website, you may be interested in my
[programming resume](programmer).

If you are a programmer yourself, I keep a [blog](blog) where I document
interesting programing discoveries, among other things. You can also find me on
[GitHub](https://github.com/captbaritone).

## Singing

I have been an active classical singer in the Bay Area since I was a teenager.
I graduated from San Francisco State University with a Bachelors in Music and
have enjoyed a busy schedule singing various opera roles with local companies
ever since.

In 2012 I helped found [Waffle Opera](http://waffleopera.com) which brings both
lively opera productions and waffles to the people of San Francisco.

You can see more about my singing, including photos and my schedule of upcoming
performances, at my [singer website](singer).

## Projects

I am perpetually involved in various personal projects, usually involving
music, software or both. You can find a list of some of my more interesting
project on my [porjects](projects) page. For a complete list, see my [old
blog](http://classicalcode.com).
