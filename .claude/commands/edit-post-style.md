Edit the blog post or note that the user provides to conform to STYLE_GUIDE.md.

Steps:
1. Read STYLE_GUIDE.md to understand all standards
2. Read the post file the user specifies
3. Make style and formatting edits to align with every applicable section of the guide
4. Explain all changes made

**Critical constraints:**
- Make ONLY style and formatting changes per STYLE_GUIDE.md
- Do NOT change the author's voice, meaning, or content
- Do NOT rewrite or add new information
- Preserve all authentic, conversational language
- Preserve technical accuracy

After making edits:
1. Summarize what you changed and why (reference specific STYLE_GUIDE.md sections)
2. Note any issues that require author judgment (content decisions, not style)
3. Confirm the post now conforms to the style guide
