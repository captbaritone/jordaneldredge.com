Review a new blog post or note draft before publishing by providing direct edit suggestions.

This is for in-progress drafts where the user wants holistic feedback on both content and style.

Steps:
1. Read STYLE_GUIDE.md to understand all standards
2. Read the draft file or content the user provides
3. Apply direct edits to fix critical issues and style guide violations
4. Update EDITORIAL_PROGRESS.md to mark the file as completed
5. Provide comprehensive feedback explaining the changes and additional suggestions

**What to review:**
- Should this be a post or note? (reference "Content Types" section of STYLE_GUIDE.md)
- Content completeness and clarity
- Structure and flow
- Authentic voice (per STYLE_GUIDE.md)
- Style guide compliance (all sections)

**How to provide feedback:**
- **First, edit the file directly** to fix:
  - Critical syntax errors and typos
  - Style guide violations (formatting, grammar, punctuation)
  - Minor content clarity issues
- **Then provide context** in your response:
  - Explain what changes were made and why
  - Suggest additional content improvements that require author input
  - Cite relevant STYLE_GUIDE.md sections
  - Show before/after for complex suggestions that weren't directly applied

Format your feedback as:
1. **Changes Made**: Summary of direct edits applied to the file
2. **Editorial Progress Updated**: Confirm the file has been marked as reviewed in EDITORIAL_PROGRESS.md
3. **First Impression**: Overall reaction and post vs. note decision (cite STYLE_GUIDE.md)
4. **Additional Suggestions**: Content improvements that need author consideration, grouped by:
   - Content enhancements (clarity, flow, depth)
   - Structural improvements
   - Advanced style considerations
5. **What Works Well**: Specific strengths to maintain

**Progress Tracking:**
When updating EDITORIAL_PROGRESS.md:
1. Move the file from pending to completed section
2. Add completion date and brief summary of changes made
3. Update the summary statistics (completed count, percentages)

**Important notes:**
- Only edit the file if you can identify the specific draft file path
- Be conservative with edits - focus on clear improvements, not subjective preferences
- Always explain your reasoning for changes made
- Be constructive and encouraging. Show, don't just tell. Prioritize content and clarity over minor style issues.
