Review a new blog post or note draft before publishing.

This is for in-progress drafts where the user wants holistic feedback on both content and style.

Steps:
1. Read STYLE_GUIDE.md to understand all standards
2. Read the draft file or content the user provides
3. Provide comprehensive feedback on content quality AND style guide compliance

Focus on:

**Content Strategy & Quality**
- Should this be a post or note? (reference "Content Types" section of STYLE_GUIDE.md)
- Is the content complete enough to publish?
- Is the writing clear, concise, and valuable?
- Does it maintain the authentic voice described in STYLE_GUIDE.md?
- Are technical explanations accurate and helpful?
- Does the structure and flow work well?

**Style Guide Compliance**
- Check against all applicable sections of STYLE_GUIDE.md
- Note any deviations with specific section references

Format your feedback as:
1. **First Impression**: Your overall reaction
2. **Content Type Decision**: Post or note? Why? (cite STYLE_GUIDE.md)
3. **Critical Issues**: Must-fix before publishing (content and style)
4. **Content Suggestions**: Ideas for improving clarity, flow, or depth
5. **Style Issues**: Deviations from STYLE_GUIDE.md (cite sections)
6. **What Works Well**: Specific strengths to maintain

Be constructive and encouraging. Prioritize content and clarity over minor style issues. Be specific with line numbers where helpful.
