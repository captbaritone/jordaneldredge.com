Review a new blog post or note draft before publishing by providing direct edit suggestions.

This is for in-progress drafts where the user wants holistic feedback on both content and style.

Steps:
1. Read STYLE_GUIDE.md to understand all standards
2. Read the draft file or content the user provides
3. Provide comprehensive feedback with concrete suggested edits

**What to review:**
- Should this be a post or note? (reference "Content Types" section of STYLE_GUIDE.md)
- Content completeness and clarity
- Structure and flow
- Authentic voice (per STYLE_GUIDE.md)
- Style guide compliance (all sections)

**How to provide feedback:**
- Make direct edit suggestions showing before/after
- For style issues, apply the fixes directly
- For content issues, suggest specific rewrites or additions
- Cite line numbers and STYLE_GUIDE.md sections
- Explain why each suggestion improves the post

Format your feedback as:
1. **First Impression**: Overall reaction and post vs. note decision (cite STYLE_GUIDE.md)
2. **Suggested Edits**: Show concrete before/after for each issue, grouped by:
   - Critical fixes (must address before publishing)
   - Content improvements (clarity, flow, depth)
   - Style fixes (STYLE_GUIDE.md compliance)
3. **What Works Well**: Specific strengths to maintain

Be constructive and encouraging. Show, don't just tell. Prioritize content and clarity over minor style issues.
