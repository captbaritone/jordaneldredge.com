I was listening to NPR today, and there was a program of some song writer who was wining an award. He sang a few of his songs and they were terrible. I decided that even I could do better than that.

So I went home and wrote and recorded a song: 
	<audio id="wp_mep_44" src="http://blog.classicalcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/ballad-of-the-man-who-cant-sing.mp3" type="audio/mp3"    controls="controls" preload="none"  >

			<param name="movie" value="http://blog.classicalcode.com/wp-content/plugins/media-element-html5-video-and-audio-player/mediaelement/flashmediaelement.swf" />
			<param name="flashvars" value="controls=true&amp;file=http://blog.classicalcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/ballad-of-the-man-who-cant-sing.mp3" />			
		</object>		
	</audio>
<script type="text/javascript">
jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
	$('#wp_mep_44').mediaelementplayer({
		m:1
		
		,features: ['playpause','current','progress','duration','volume','tracks','fullscreen']
		,audioWidth:500,audioHeight:30
	});
});
</script>

Not being a song writer, I wrote the song about not being able to write.

Apologies to: Tom Waits (Take it with me when I'm gone), Joanna Newsom (Emily), and Traditional (Deep River). I don't think there is an original note in the whole song.

Lyrics:

> I find myself weeping in my little room,  
> The turn-table's turning its playing a tune  
> The song tells of roses and thorns on the vine  
> A beautiful story of a man's wasted life.  

> The man is a martyr, he suffered for love  
> He'll find his redemption when they meet up above.  
> But why am I crying, this isn't my fate,  
> I'm crying for something I cannot relate.  

> If your drunk, or heartbroken, you can easily find  
> someone who's been there to help ease your mind  
> But I cannot put my own thoughts in a row.  
> Or put them together for others to know  

> And that's why I crying, alone in my room,  
> I can't seem to figure the words or the tune,  
> To make you see that I cannot get out  
> any of thoughts I am thinking about
