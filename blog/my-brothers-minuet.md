My <a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~neldredg/">brother</a> took a music course in his undergrad and as part of his coursework wrote a minuet. Its been sitting on the piano at home for some time, and a few days ago my parents, on the advice of my aunt, suggested that I record it for my grandparents. So, without further ado, here is "Minuet" by Nate Eldredge.

(Please excuse my pedantic playing, and the added <strike>upper</strike> lower neighbor tone "embellishment" near the end of the first repetition of the "B" section.)
