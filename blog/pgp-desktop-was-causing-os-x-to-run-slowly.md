After months of my laptop running slower and slower, to the point where I stopped using it completely, I broke down and took it into the apple store. They checked everything they could think of but eventually told me they thought that I just had installed too many "apps" that were running the background. I have been running <a href="http://gnupg.org/">GPG</a> for some time now, but still had <a href="http://www.pgp.com/">PGP Desktop</a> installed, because I simply could not figure out how to uninstall it. Somehow I managed to overlook the giant UNINSTALL button. Anyway, turns out that PGP Desktop was strangling my computer. But don't worry. It's all better now.
