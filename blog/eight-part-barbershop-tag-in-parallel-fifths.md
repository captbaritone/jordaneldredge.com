I have recently observed, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TbBZkh9PIs">on Youtube</a>, a very interesting method of turning any barbershop tag into a jazzy eight part tag: simply double each part a perfect fifth higher. Or, said another way, have a second quartet simultaneously sing the same tag a fifth above.

Despite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consecutive_fifths">everything I was taught in college</a>, I have been curious to try this myself. However, due to sound bleed-through from my upstairs neighbors, I can't really record in my apartment these days. So I multitracked this one tonight in my car on my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LGA2K6?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=winterjourna-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000LGA2K6">Zoom H4</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=winterjourna-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000LGA2K6" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />. Although I am sure I looked quite suspicious, I think it was worth it.

You can hear the original four part arrangement <a href="http://blog.classicalcode.com/2009/05/in-dixie-land-where-i-was-born/">here</a>.
