The server that hosts this blog (as well as all my other projects) has had a severe problem ever since I upgraded to Gutsy several weeks ago. It would crash after running for about a day or so. While I still don't know what the actual problem was, my <a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~neldredg/">brother</a> and I were able to solve the problem by downgrading to the previous version of the linux kernel. It now has uptime of over three days, which seems to indicate that the problem has been fixed.
