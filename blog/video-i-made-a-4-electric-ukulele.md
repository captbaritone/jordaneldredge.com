While I was home for Christmas, I was watching lots of ukulele videos on Youtube. Somewhere in my wanderings I came across the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuqQWon71do">Risa Uke Solid</a> and my mind was blown. It's a small electric ukulele made out of a single solid piece of wood and some hardware. The simplicity of the design made me think: "Hey, I could do that" and so I began thinking about how I could make a simple electric ukulele myself. Two days later, with lots of help from my dad and his tools, I have a working electric ukulele made from stuff I found around my parent's house and a set of $4 ukulele strings. It's currently fret-less and the pickup leaves a lot to be desired but my goal was really to create a mock-up so that I would know what I was doing when I built the actual thing.

<strong>Epilogue:</strong>

Possible improvements on this model:
<ul>
	<li>Frets</li>
	<li>Deepen groove on back</li>
</ul>
Things to learn before building next model:
<ul>
	<li>Are there shorter tuning pegs so that I can avoid drilling the extra hole?</li>
	<li>Are there better pickup solutions for my price range?</li>
</ul>
Improvements for next model:
<ul>
	<li>Less space between tuning pegs</li>
	<li>Harder wood</li>
	<li>No taper</li>
	<li>Strings further apart at nut</li>
	<li>Narrower holes for strings at nut</li>
	<li>Standard G-C-E-A strings</li>
</ul>
