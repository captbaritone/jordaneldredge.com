The awesome nerd over at <a href="http://geoff.greer.fm/">Geoff's Boring Programming Stuff</a> gave me the biggest compliment a programmer could recieve. <a href="http://geoff.greer.fm/2009/05/05/refresh-cannon-bot/">He wrote a program</a> to use <a href="http://blog.classicalcode.com/?p=471">my program</a>! As he points out in his post, it seems pretty clear that he is not the only one. If there is anything more rewarding than that, I can't think what it would be. Thanks Geoff.
