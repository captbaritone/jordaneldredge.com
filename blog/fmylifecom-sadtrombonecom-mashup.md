<strong>EDIT (May 18, 2012): FML has changed their API to require a key, I have written them asking for such a key.</strong>

After experiencing the joy of following every <a href="http://www.fmylife.com">FMyLife.com</a> entry with a trip to <a href="http://www.sadtrombone.com">SadTrombone.com</a> I decided to throw together a mash up.

<a href="http://www.classicalcode.com/projects/sadtrombonemylife/" target="_blank">Sad Trombone My Life</a> serves up endless doses of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude">schadenfreude</a> with comedy brass chasers.
