In an attempt to find a way to put my multitracks on youtube, I came up with a neat idea. Show all four parts of a tag in sol-feg hand signs as it is sung. This could be a great tool for visual learners to both learn a barbershop tag, and hone their hand sign reading skills, a skill that is usually hard to practice without the help of another sol-feg nerd.
