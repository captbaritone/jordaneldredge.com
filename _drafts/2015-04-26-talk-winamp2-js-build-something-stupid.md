On April 21st, I gave a short talk at the [San Francisco JavaScript
Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/jsmeetup/). It was ostensibly about my
[Winamp2-js](/projects/winamp2-js/) project, but my
real goal was to help encourage people to build "stupid" projects.

To highlight the interesting kinds of problems you can encounter when you
pursue stupid projects, I discussed some of the technical challenges involved
in supporting native Winamp skins.

The organizers were kind enough to put the talk you Youtube:

If you are interested in my slides, you can find them here:

To use JavaScript examples in the slides are in no way robust, but it should
work if you drag in any [Winamp skin
file](https://github.com/captbaritone/winamp-skins/raw/master/v2/base-2.91.wsz).
