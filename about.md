Hello! My name is Jordan Eldredge. I am a programmer and classical singer
living in San Francisco with my wife, and fellow singer, [Chelsea
Hollow](http://chelseahollow.com).

## Programming

I've been writing web software as a hobby since I was in High School. After
college, it evolved naturally into a career. Since about 2009 I have been
a full-time engineer.

If you are looking for a software engineer, you may be interested in my
[programming page](programmer).

If you are a programmer yourself, I keep a [blog](blog) where I document
interesting programing discoveries, among other things. You can also find me on
[GitHub](https://github.com/captbaritone).

## Singing

I have been an active classical singer in the Bay Area since I was a teenager.
I graduated from San Francisco State University with a Bachelors in Music and
have enjoyed a busy schedule singing various opera roles with local companies
ever since.

You can see more about my singing, including photos and my schedule of upcoming
performances, at my [singer website](singer).

## Projects

I am perpetually involved in various personal projects, usually involving
music, software or both. You can find a list of some of my more interesting
project on my [projects](projects) page.
