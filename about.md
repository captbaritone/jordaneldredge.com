Hello! My name is Jordan Eldredge. I am a programmer and classical singer
living in the San Francisco Bay Area with my wife [Chelsea
Hollow](http://chelseahollow.com) and awesome daughter.

## Programming

I've been writing web software as a hobby since I was in High School. After
college, it evolved naturally into a career. Since about 2009 I have been
a full-time engineer. I currently work at Facebook on the [Nuclide](https://nuclide.io/) team.

Check out my [projects](projects) page or [GitHub profile](https://github.com/captbaritone).

## Singing

I have been an active opera singer in the Bay Area since I was a teenager.
I graduated from San Francisco State University with a Bachelors in Music and
have enjoyed a busy singing schedule ever since.

You can see more about my singing, including photos and my schedule of upcoming
performances, at my [singer website](singer).
