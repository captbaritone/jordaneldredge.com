This tag from the seminal <a href="http://www.stampedecitychorus.com/classic_tags_men2.pdf">book of tags</a> seemed quite fitting to multitrack. This is "All By Myself Alone" number. I found that the lead part was actually easier for me to sing a whole step higher because the C was right in the middle of my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passaggio">passagio</a>, and it was pushing sharp. So this one is in D.

Biggest challenges:

* Fan noise from my server and laptop
* Giving the music emotion without going out of tune
