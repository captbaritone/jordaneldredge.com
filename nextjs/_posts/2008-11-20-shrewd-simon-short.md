My mom recently sent me a link to a Youtube video of a great tongue twister segment from Pinkey and the Brain:

Searching for a transcript of this segment I came across <a href="http://www.davescooltoys.com/twists.html">a page of tongue twisters</a> which contained a great story about "Shrewd Simon Short" in which every word started with the letter "s". In order to best appreciate it I attempted to read it aloud. It sounded amusing enough that I decided to record it. So, donning my best book-on-tape narrator voice, I made the following recording:
