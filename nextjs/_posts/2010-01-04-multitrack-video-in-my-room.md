On New Years Day my brother, Nate, and I spent the day relaxing with my girlfriend, Chelsea, and her room mate Joel. It was a lovely day and in the evening we decided to record a song. We decided to record (and film) The Beach Boys' song "In My Room" by <a title="Brian Wilson" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Wilson">Brian Wilson</a> and <a title="Gary Usher" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Usher">Gary Usher</a>. We were quite lucky to find a transcription of the voice parts <a href="http://beach-boys.aure.com/">here</a>.

The results:
