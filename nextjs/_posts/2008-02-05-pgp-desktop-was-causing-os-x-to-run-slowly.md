title: "PGP Desktop was causing OS X to run slowly"

After months of my laptop running slower and slower, to the point where
I stopped using it completely, I broke down and took it into the apple store.
They checked everything they could think of but eventually told me they thought
that I just had installed too many "apps" that were running the background.
I have been running [GPG](http://gnupg.org/) for some time now, but still had
[PGP Desktop](http://www.pgp.com/) installed, because I simply could not figure
out how to uninstall it. Somehow I managed to overlook the giant UNINSTALL
button. Anyway, turns out that PGP Desktop was strangling my computer. But
don't worry. It's all better now.
