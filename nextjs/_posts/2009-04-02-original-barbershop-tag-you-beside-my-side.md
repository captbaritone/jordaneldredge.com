A few days ago, I wrote a barbershop tag for my girlfriend <a href="http://www.chelseahollow.com">Chelsea</a>.

My multitrack of the tag (sung a half step lower than written):
<audio id="wp_mep_32" src="{{ site.url }}/uploads/2009/04/you-beside-my-side.mp3" type="audio/mp3"    controls="controls" preload="none"  ></audio>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/uploads/2009/04/n11701795_32394280_475.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-411 aligncenter" title="n11701795_32394280_475" alt="n11701795_32394280_475" src="{{ site.url }}/uploads/2009/04/n11701795_32394280_475-500x375.jpg" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
My goal was to write a "bloom" type tag where all voices<span id="more-403"></span> start on a single unison note, and travel in smooth contrary motion to the final chord. Some great examples of this kind of tag are <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/barbershop-multi-track-cry/">Cry</a> and <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/tag-sleepy-time-down-south/">Sleepy Time</a>. I took this idea so its logical extreme by using almost entirely chromatic contrary motion. In fact, of the melodic intervals in the tag, 19 are half steps, 9 are whole steps and 2 are perfect fourths.

I made a little video that teaches you all the parts by ear:
