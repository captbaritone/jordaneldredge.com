My birthday was a few days ago, and two different people, knowing my love of barbershop, sent me a [Youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1ljOdTM9l4) of a quartet singing "Happy Birthday". This got me thinking about barbershop arrangments of the song. 

Today is my friend Amanda Ortmayer's birthday and I wanted to give her something, so I decided to arrange and multitrack "Happy Birthday" for her in the barbershop style. 

Happy birthday Amanda, thanks for being such a constant, caring friend.
