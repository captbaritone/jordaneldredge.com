__Edit (May 18, 2012): This project is no-longer online.__

Since <a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~neldredg/">my brother</a> introduced
me to <a href="http://foundmagazine.com/">Found Magazine</a> several years ago,
watching the gutter and sidewalk for interesting things has become a hobby of
mine. Unfortunately I was never able to find a good website on which to post
the things I found. Found Magazine has an online section called "Find of the
Day" but it only allows tiny images, and the wait to get your finds posted is
interminable. Fed up, I designed, coded and published my own solution to this
internet shortcoming. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you: <a
href="http://www.guttergold.com">GutterGold.com</a>. Feel free to peruse, rate
and comment upon my finds, subscribe to the RSS feed, or post some of your own
finds. Also: tell your friends!

From the site, "<a href="http://www.guttergold.com/find.php?f=46">Training to Be a Spy</a>":<a href="http://www.guttergold.com/find.php?f=46"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-322" title="Trainging to be a spy" src="/uploads/2009/01/46_med.jpg" alt="Trainging to be a spy" width="500" height="384" /></a>
