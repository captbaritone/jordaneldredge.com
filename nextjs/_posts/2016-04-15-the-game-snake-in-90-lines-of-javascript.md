After watching [Coding an HTML5 Game in 5 min 30
sec](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoWqdEACyLI) in which Chris DeLeon
programs a Pong clone in Notepad, I was inspired to write a game myself.
I opted to clone Snake and took a minimal approach. My goal was to do it with
as little code as possible while still keeping the code very readable.

Obviously this is highly subjective, but I think I found a balance where there
is hardly any extraneous code, but anyone with a small amount of JavaScript
experience could read thought the code and understand everything.
