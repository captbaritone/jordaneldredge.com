In an attempt to record something for <a href="http://www.chelseahollow.com">Chelsea</a> (she has been away for almost a month now) I decided to record one of my favorite love songs, Everything I Have is Yours. I believe that only version of it that I have heard was a Bing Crosby recording that had been doctored to sound like it was on a really old phonograph for a play.

I have never had any faith in my ability to come up with harmony parts by ear, I always need a piece of paper and a pencil for that, so I decided to challenge myself.

Apparently my ear harmonies are possessed by Lord Satan.

The aftermath:
