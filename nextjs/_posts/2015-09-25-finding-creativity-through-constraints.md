[Hearsay Social](http://hearsaysocial.com/careers/), where I work, recently
started a series of internal talks intended to highlight the many personalities
within the company and I was asked to give the inaugural talk.

The talk I gave is entitled "Finding Creativity Through Constraints", and you
can watch it below:
