I created this arrangement of "Ah, leave me not to pine" from Gilbert and
Sullivan's [_The Pirates of
Penzance_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirates_of_Penzance) many years
ago. Since then I've played it quite a bit, but never practiced it with enough
rigour to record it. Over the last few days I finally sat down and learned it
well enough to make a passable recording. I hope you enjoy:
