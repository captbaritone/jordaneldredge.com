After talking about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_tone">Shepard Tone</a>, an audio illusion that can create an endlessly rising or falling scale, with my friend <a href="http://www.benjaminpender.com/">Ben Pender</a>, I decided to try to create one using <a href="http://lilypond.org/web/">Lilypond</a>. The result is quite interesting.

Chromatically rising Shepard Tone:

The midi file created by Lilypond: <a href="/uploads/2009/03/shepard_tone.midi">shepard_tone.midi</a>

<a href="https://github.com/captbaritone/eldredge-shepard_tone">The Lilypond source used to render the above .midi (on GitHub)</a>

A wav file generated from the midi file above: <a title="Download as .wav" href="/uploads/2009/03/shepard_tone.wav">shepard_tone.wav</a> (43M)

An mp3 file generated from the wav file above:<br />
