After talking about the [Shepard Tone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_tone), an audio illusion that can create an endlessly rising or falling scale, with my friend [Ben Pender](http://www.benjaminpender.com/), I decided to try to create one using [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org/web/). The result is quite interesting.

Chromatically rising Shepard Tone:

The midi file created by Lilypond: [shepard_tone.midi](/uploads/2009/03/shepard_tone.midi)

[The Lilypond source used to render the above .midi (on GitHub)](https://github.com/captbaritone/eldredge-shepard_tone)

A wav file generated from the midi file above: <a title="Download as .wav" href="/uploads/2009/03/shepard_tone.wav">shepard_tone.wav</a> (43M)

An mp3 file generated from the wav file above:<br />
