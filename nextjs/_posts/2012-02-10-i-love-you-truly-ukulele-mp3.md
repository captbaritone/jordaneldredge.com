With <a href="http://chelseahollow.com">Chelsea</a> traveling all over the country on her graduate school auditions I had both the time and motivation to record her a little song. Although this one is not original, it is the same style as the <a href="/blog/electric-ukulele-ring-tone-for-chelsea/">two</a> <a href="/blog/the-surprise-slide-ukulele-micro-song/">previous</a> ring tones I made for her. The song has four electric ukulele tracks and one electric bass track.

> I love you truly, truly dear,  
> Life with its sorrow, life with its tears  
> Fades into dreams when I feel you are near  
> For I love you truly, truly dear.  

> Ah! Love, 'tis something to feel your kind hand  
> Ah! Yes, 'tis something by your side to stand;  
> Gone is the sorrow, gone doubt and fear,  
> For you love me truly, truly dear.
