Inspired by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtsjKPqKgzg">several</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFWYSW4vfcA&amp;feature=related">examples</a> on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKK5I9_LFZM&amp;feature=related">YouTube</a>, and my curiosity about the subject, I attempted to do some non-throat-singing overtone singing. I was surprised that I was able to get the results I did.

Things I learned:

* Higher notes work better for me.
* The more closed my mouth is the clearer the overtones are heard
