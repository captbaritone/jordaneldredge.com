Chelsea's videographer friend Beau Lambert was recently staying with us and
graciously offered to record a few songs. Beau set up his camera in our
backyard and Chelsea and I thought up a few songs that we could record. We only
did one or two takes of each one, so the whole ordeal was really just informal
and fun. Hopefully you will enjoy. Oh, make sure to pay attention to Chelsea's
hand-drawn title cards!

Chelsea's parents, Tom and Grace, wrote the "Nammies Song" to help their kids go to sleep at night.

"The Diaper Changing Blues" was written by Chelsea's mom Grace, for Chelsea's little brother Thomas who was not fond of having his diaper changed.

"The Beard Song" was one of the first ukulele songs I fell in love with on
Youtube. It was written by Rocky and Balls. <a
