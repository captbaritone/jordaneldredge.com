I have been dreaming about <a href="/blog/video-i-made-a-4-electric-ukulele/">electric ukuleles</a> for years
now, and have been dreaming with a passion ever since I found the <a
href="http://www.eleukeusa.com/">Eleuke</a> on Youtube. Well, I finally decided
to buy one and could not be happier. Here is my first video on my new tenor
Eleuke. The arrangement is based on (stolen from) a beautiful version I heard
on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HeSS7-jW-E">Youtube</a>.
