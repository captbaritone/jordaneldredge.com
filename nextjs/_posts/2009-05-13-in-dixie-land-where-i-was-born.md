Since I <a href="/blog/my-first-barbershop-multi-track-love-letters/">began multitracking</a>, my recordings have suffered from "recorded-with-the-built-in-microphone-itis" which has greatly reduced the quality of my multitracks. Recently I got my hands on a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zoom-ZOO-H4-Handy-Recorder/dp/B000LGA2K6">Zoom H4</a> "Handy Recorder".

<a href="/uploads/2009/05/zoom-h4.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-498" style="border: 2px solid black;" title="zoom-h4" src="/uploads/2009/05/zoom-h4-266x300.jpg" alt="zoom-h4" width="266" height="300" /></a>

This thing is awesome. In one portable package its: a high quality USB microphone, a portable recorder, a four-track machine, an effects pedal, and much more. To take the new contraption for a spin, I recorded an old favorite tag. I did all the multitracking on the Zoom, and then transferred the individual tracks to my MacBook where I added reverb and adjusted some levels (which I could have done on board if I had wanted to).

I have recorded this tag a <a href="/blog/barbershop-multi-track-mothers-day-gift/">few</a> <a href="/blog/barbershop-multitrack-tag-overtone-experiment-robot-quartet/">times</a> before on my MacBook microphone and the difference of sound quality is pretty noticeable. Have a listen to this new recording of "In Dixie Land Where I Was Born":
