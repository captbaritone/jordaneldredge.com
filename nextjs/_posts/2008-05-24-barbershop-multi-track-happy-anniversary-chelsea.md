If she had been dating a real singer, he probably would have written her a sweet love song by now. But, for reasons I still don't understand, she chose me instead. So instead of a whole love song, she just gets a barbershop love tag.

I love you Chelsea. Thanks for putting up with me and my nerdy ways for a whole year and a half.

Written and recorded for Chelsea:
