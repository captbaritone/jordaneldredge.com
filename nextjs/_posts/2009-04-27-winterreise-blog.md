For a while now I have been trying to learn everything I can about Franz Schubert's Winterreise. In the course of my journey, I have found countless articles, essays, videos, recordings and scores. In the hopes that my research might be useful, or at least interesting, to someone else I have started the <a title="Winterreise" href="http://winterreise.classicalcode.com">Winterreise</a> blog. My goal is to have this be both <em>the</em> reference and news source for all things related to Winterreise. To that end, I intend to have a new post about every three days. So far I have five posts written and in the queue with about fifteen post ideas still to be written. So, subscribe to [the rss feed](http://winterreise.classicalcode.com/?feed=rss2) and follow along!
