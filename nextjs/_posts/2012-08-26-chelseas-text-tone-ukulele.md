Here's one from the archives. Last year Chelsea had her phone stolen on Muni. As a security measure she wanted to switch to a text-tone that did not scream "I have en expensive phone in my purse!" whenever she received a text. To help her out I wrote and recorded this tiny (even by <a href="/blog/original-song-our-love-will-last-as-long/">my standards</a>!) ukulele track. I have in my records that I sent it to her on July 15th, 2011.Â Feel free to use it your iPhone.
