Due to a rehearsal, I am not going to be able to see my Mama on Mother's Day, so I am celebrating it with her a day early. My acquaintance/idol/current-ipod-favorite [H.P. Mendoza](http://www.hpmendoza.com/), and a girl at [16th and Mission Poetry](http://www.16thmission.com/) who read a poem about her mom, reminded me that being an artist is pointless if you can't use your art form to express yourself.  So for Mother's Day I made my mom an audio/barbershop Hallmark greeting card multi-tracked in a noisy practice room at school.

Happy Mother's Day Lisa:
