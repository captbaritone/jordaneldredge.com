Another attempt at barbershop multi-tracking:

Still to work on:
<ul>
	<li>Rhythm (especially bad in bell chord: "gone, gone, gone, gone")</li>
	<li>Consonants (Clear, but unobtrusive)</li>
</ul>
Again, this tag is from <a href="http://www.stampedecitychorus.com/classic_tags_men2.pdf">this</a> (No. 19) collection of barbershop tags. The arranger is not cited, but the .pdf says the tag was sung by the Dealer's Choice in 1973.

The tag:
